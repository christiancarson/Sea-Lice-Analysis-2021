## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Working Directory}
wd <- "/Users/user/Documents/GitHub/Sea-Lice-Analysis-2021"  #Suggest using wd <- getwd() -ML
setwd(wd)
getwd()
folders <- c("Code", "Data", "OutputFigures", "OutputData")

# function to create folders below
for(i in 1:length(folders)){
  if(file.exists(folders[i]) == FALSE)
    dir.create(folders[i])
}

# we also need to store the paths to these new folders

code.output.path <- paste(wd, "/", folders[1], sep = "")
data.input.path <- paste(wd, "/", folders[2], sep = "")
figures.path <- paste(wd, "/", folders[3], sep = "")
data.output.path <- paste(wd, "/", folders[4], sep = "")

# our raw data is stored in different folders, lets make the paths
sealicedata.path <- paste(getwd(), "/Data", "/", sep = "")

# now we can access and save stuff to these folders!
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
