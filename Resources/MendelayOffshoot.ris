AB  - This chapter discusses the laboratory and in situ methods for studying deep-sea fishes. Laboratory studies of living, deep-sea fishes require their capture, recovery, and maintenance. Two primary factors influencing the physiological condition of deep-sea fishes collected for laboratory studies are increasing temperature and decompression. Thermally insulated cod ends have been successfully developed and used on a variety of opening–closing midwater trawls and epibenthic sleds to collect and recover living bathypelagic animals for metabolic studies in shipboard laboratories. Temperature-insulated traps also have been employed for collecting scavenging deep-sea fishes. Such traps have been either attached to long pull lines extending to depth from the surface or configured as free vehicles. Free-vehicle acoustic monitoring systems have been developed to study the abundance, movements, and behavior of bathypelagic animals using noninvasive active sonar. The prototypes of these vertically profiling acoustic arrays with single transducers have now been successfully used to study nekton over a seamount and under the Antarctic pack ice.

AB  - The details of the receptor mechanism are not yet fully understood for any sensory system. However, sufficient data are available (for the vestibular system and for other systems) to permit meaningful tracking of the sensory messages through the nervous system and via conscious experience. The reception, process ing, storage and output of information in man and other animals, as done by means of receptors, neurons, secretory cells and muscle fibers, are collectively referred to as mind. Sensory physiologists tend to disbelieve in extrasensory perception. Sensory physiology in general is an area upon which different sciences and methods converge. Anatomists, physiologists, psychologists, physicists, chemists, and engineers have made important contributions to sensory physiology. What is special about vestibular physiology is the fact that many research workers are clinicians, living under the constant pressure of their patient's demands. This is a disadvantage when it comes to writing handbooks, but an advantage for the pa tient, since research is guided by clinical practice and can be quickly applied. Modern methods, such as recording from single nerve units and the correlation of electrophysiological and psychophysical data, have greatly contributed to our knowledge, yet the study of lesions is still important, especially in the vestibular field.

AB  - This chapter discusses the effects of pressure on shallow-water fishes. The measurements of the concentrations of various substances in organs and/ or tissues are generally performed on tissue samples taken from fishes that are first exposed to high pressure and then decompressed. It is observed that when isolated muscle is pressurized, an increase in maximum twitch tension and in the time taken to reach peak tension is noted. It is found that when isolated gill preparations are incubated in artificial seawater and then submitted to hydrostatic pressure, various changes occur in tissue Na+, K+, and Cl- contents, depending on the experimental pressure. Na+ content varies much more rapidly than CI- and K+. In shallow-water fishes exposed to the pressures of about 50–100 ATA, changes in ion contents are principally because of changes in permeability and not to changes in active transport. The effects are mainly an increase in Na+ content and a decrease in K+ content. The information provided in the chapter shows that a shallow-water fish is able to acclimatize to high pressure and that during this acclimatization physiological changes occur that makes the fishes less sensitive to further compression. The acclimatization of trout and goldfish for at least 21 days at 101 ATA has also been successful, provided that care was taken to compress the fish slowly.

AB  - Government agencies, non-governmental organizations, commercial enterprises, and academic research programs have established a vast array of environmental databases for programmatic and research purposes. Most of these use different data management infrastructures that prevent repurposing or integrating information to serve other uses. Creating capacity to integrate and access disparate data streams enormously increases their value and application potential. Building on existing environmental information management expertise, USC has launched a Southeast Regional integration testbed (SRIT), and used this new capacity to implement an end-to-end decision support application that links monitoring data with predictive models in order to provide advance warning of impending beach contamination. The water quality Portlet project design reported herein serves as an exemplar toward establishing a sustained Center for Integrated Information Systems and Coastal Ocean Observations (CIISCOO) that will promote flexible, real-time data interoperability, across a wide user base, to efficiently meet evolving future needs.

AB  - Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the feeding habits and deep-sea energetics of deep-sea fishes. Direct evidence concerning the feeding habits of deep-sea fishes comes principally from the analysis of gut contents. Deep-sea fishes feed extensively on demersal prey whose distributions are closely associated with the bottom of the sea; however, many demersal fishes feed principally on vertically migrating mesopelagic organisms, such as myctophids and cephalopods. The presence of pelagic prey in the diets of demersal fishes has been interpreted both as an evidence of the occurrence of mesopelagic prey near the bottom and of off-bottom migrations by some demersal species into the mesopelagic realm to feed. Most demersal deep-sea fish species are microphagous, preying on small benthopelagic and epibenthic invertebrates, especially crustaceans. A special subguild of benthivores is adapted as durophages, capable of crushing thick-shelled mollusks and other armored invertebrates. The chemical composition of demersal fishes is also correlated with buoyancy mechanisms. Benthic and benthopelagic species with swim bladders have lower water contents and higher skeletal ash, nitrogen, carbon, and energy contents than do benthopelagic species without swim bladders.

AB  - This chapter examines the maintenance of biochemical function by fishes in the deep sea. Deep-sea fishes generally have much larger ranges in the depth of occurrence than do shallow-living species and they are more likely to experience large changes in pressure over their life-span. A general theme appearing in biochemical studies of deep-sea fishes is that adaptation to high and variable pressures has entailed the evolution of pressure-insensitive forms of enzymes, rather than enzymes adapted for function at a specific range of high pressures. Interactions among the subunits of multimeric proteins provide a relatively straightforward example of the biochemical effects of pressure because they can be studied as simple equilibria between monomers and polymers. The comparison of lactate dehydrogenase kinetic properties in Sebustolohus suggests that environmental pressures as low as 5 MPa have been sufficient to select for homologs for which substrate binding is relatively unaffected by pressure. It has been found that the deep-sea thermophile, Methanococcus jnnntischii, exhibits pressure-dependent changes in the proportions of three isopranoid ether lipids.

AB  - © The authors 2018. ABSTRACT: The trophic structure and role of chemosynthesis remain unexplored in deep-sea whale-fall communities in areas other than the California margin. This gap limits the understanding of these communities and their ecological relationships with other chemosynthetic ecosystems, such as vents and seeps. Here, we studied 3 different whale skeleton microhabitats with hypothesized high, intermediate and low reducing conditions as well as the sediments surrounding an abyssal whale fall (4204 m depth, SW Atlantic Ocean). We analyzed trophic structures (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) and the contribution of chemosynthetically derived carbon to heterotrophic species. The high and intermediate reducing microhabitats harbored food webs dominated by consumers of chemosynthetic production, similar to those of diffusive areas of hydrothermal vents and seeps. Both the low reducing microhabitat and the sediments  harbored food webs with greater trophic complexity, dominated by higher consumers mainly relying on whale and/or photosynthesis-derived organic matter, a type of food web commonly reported in small whale, wood and kelp falls. The main whale-fall ecosystem engineer, the bone-eating worm Osedax, appeared to produce unique food web effects not observed in other chemosynthetic habitats. We conclude that whale falls provide the deep sea with a mosaic of microhabitats that supports assemblages with different chemosynthesis reliance levels and trophic structures, similar to those found at vents and seeps. Such a mosaic allows species-rich communities with numerous trophic levels to develop in a very small area of the food-limited deep sea.

AB  - Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the morphology of ocean basins, the biophysics of oceans, and oceanic food webs. Most of the 92 natural elements have been detected dissolved in seawater, although the majority occurs only in trace concentrations. The density of seawater plays a key role in ecological processes through determining the stability of oceanic water columns and contributing to the patterns of ocean circulation. Seawater density is determined by three factors: hydrostatic pressure, temperature, and salinity. The presence of trenches along the margins of continents has an important effect on sedimentation regimes, and hence on the ecology of abyssal plains. The oceanic margins impinging on the continental land masses may be either active or passive. Around the Pacific, the margins are active. The crust is buckling down (subducting) beneath the continental land masses to form deep trenches. The trenches trap any sediment transport and turbidity flows that result from mass-wasting events and slope failures triggered by the heightened seismic activity along the continental margins. Some of the most striking eddy features are to be seen in remotely sensed images of either sea-surface temperatures or ocean color of eastern boundary current regions. In the open ocean, the annual quantity and seasonal cycling of primary production is determined by vertical stratification, the light cycle, and the persistence of nutrient supplies.

AB  - Whale falls produce remarkable organic- and sulfide-rich habitat islands at the seafloor. The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in studies of modern and fossil whale remains, yielding exciting new insights into whale-fall ecosystems. Giant body sizes and especially high bone-lipid content allow great-whale carcasses to support a sequence of heterotrophic and chemosynthetic microbial assemblages in the energy-poor deep sea. Deep-sea metazoan communities at whale falls pass through a series of overlapping successional stages that vary with carcass size, water depth, and environmental conditions. These metazoan communities contain many new species and evolutionary novelties, including bone-eating worms and snails and a diversity of grazers on sulfur bacteria. Molecular and paleoecological studies suggest that whale falls have served as hot spots of adaptive radiation for a specialized fauna; they have also provided evolutionary stepping stones for vent and seep mussels and could have facilitated speciation in other vent/seep taxa.

AB  - Here we consider the role of depth as a driver of evolution in a genus of deep-sea fishes. We provide a phylogeny for the genus Coryphaenoides (Gadiformes: Macrouridae) that represents the breadth of habitat use and distributions for these species. In our consensus phylogeny species found at abyssal depths (>4000 m) form a well-supported lineage, which interestingly also includes two non-abyssal species, C. striaturus and C. murrayi, diverging from the basal node of that lineage. Biogeographic analyses suggest the genus may have originated in the Southern and Pacific Oceans where contemporary species diversity is highest. The abyssal lineage seems to have arisen secondarily and likely originated in the Southern/Pacific Oceans but diversification of this lineage occurred in the Northern Atlantic Ocean. All abyssal species are found in the North Atlantic with the exception of C. yaquinae in the North Pacific and C. filicauda in the Southern Ocean. Abyssal species tend to have broad depth ranges and wide distributions, indicating that the stability of the deep oceans and the ability to live across wide depths may promote population connectivity and facilitate large ranges. We also confirm that morphologically defined subgenera do not agree with our phylogeny and that the Giant grenadier (formerly Albatrossia pectoralis) belongs to Coryphaenoides, indicating that a taxonomic revision of the genus is needed. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the radiation and diversification of this genus, and the likely role of adaptation to the abyss.

AB  - We used a quiet, deep-diving remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to conduct oblique, quantitative video transects of the bathypelagic fauna at depths between 1000 and 3500. m at a site over the Monterey Submarine Canyon, in the eastern North Pacific off central California. Fifteen such dives were made over a two-year period. Analyses of the video data revealed a rich and diverse fauna dominated by gelatinous animals. In particular, the holopelagic polychaete Poeobius meseres was an important detritivore in the upper half of this depth range. As Poeobius abundance eventually declined with increasing depth, larvacean abundance increased. In contrast, the relative numbers of crustacean grazers, principally copepods and mysids, remained relatively constant with depth. Medusae were most abundant and most diverse among the gelatinous predators, which also included ctenophores, and siphonophores. Chaetognaths occurred chiefly in the upper half of the depth range. While there is considerable overlap, the bathypelagic fauna can be separated into upper (1000 to 2300. m) and lower (2400 to 3300. m) zones, as well as a distinct and populous benthic boundary layer. Within the overall bathypelagic community is a complex web of trophic links involving gelatinous predators that feed on both gelatinous and hard-bodied particle feeders, as well as on each other. The amount of organic carbon contained in this jelly web is substantial but its ecological fate is uncertain. The assessment of bathypelagic communities will be important for establishing baselines to conserve deep pelagic biodiversity within high-seas protected areas. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using an extensive observational video transect time-series, this study seeks to illustrate any seasonal or non-seasonal patterns that may exist within Monterey Bay’s rare midwater animal community. 20 unique midwater species were selected from a database based on their relative frequency and ease of identification. While no statistical standardization exists to define a “rare species,” this study chose to focus on species that were observed with a frequency of approximately ≤1%. Total species abundance was averaged into monthly totals and compared to various factors including mixed-layer depth (MLD), upwelling, seasonal currents, and a Multivariate El Niño Southern Oscillation Index (MEI). Based on multidimensional scaling (MDS), seasonal correlations appear to exist within every selected factor with a possible lagged correlation within the non-seasonal MEI and overall annual species abundance.

AB  - A unique 16-year time series of deep video surveys in Monterey Bay reveals that the Humboldt squid, Dosidicus gigas, has substantially expanded its perennial geographic range in the eastern North Pacific by invading the waters off central California. This sustained range expansion coincides with changes in climate-linked oceanographic conditions and a reduction in competing top predators. It is also coincident with a decline in the abundance of Pacific hake, the most important commercial groundfish species off western North America. Recognizing the interactive effects of multiple changes in the environment is an issue of growing concern in ocean conservation and sustainability research.

AB  - Cold seep communities discovered at three previously unknown sites between 600 and 1000 m in Monterey Bay, California, are dominated by chemoautotrophic bacteria (Beggiatoa sp.) and vesicomyid clams (5 sp.). Other seep-associated fauna included galatheid crabs (Munidopsis sp.), vestimentiferan worms (Lamellibrachia barhami?), solemyid clams (Solemya sp.), columbellid snails (Mitrella permodesta, Amphissa sp.), and pyropeltid limpets (Pyropelta sp.). More than 50 species of regional (i.e. non-seep) benthic fauna were also observed at seeps. Ratios of stable carbon isotopes (Î´13C) in clam tissues near -36â€° indicate sulfur-oxidizing chemosynthetic production, rather than non-seep food sources, as their principal trophic pathway. The 'Mt Crushmore' cold seep site is located in a vertically faulted and fractured region of the Pliocene Purisima Formation along the walls of Monterey Canyon (~635 m), where seepage appears to derive from sulfide-rich fluids within the Purisima Formation. The 'Clam Field' cold seep site, also in Monterey Canyon (~900 m) is located near outcrops in the hydrocarbon-bearing Monterey Formation. Chemosynthetic communities were also found at an accretionary-like prism on the continental slope near 1000 m depth (Clam Flat site). Fluid flow at the 'Clam Flat' site is thought to represent dewatering of accretionary sediments by tectonic compression, or hydrocarbon formation at depth, or both. Sulfide levels in pore waters were low at Mt Crushmore (ca 0.2 mM), and high at the two deeper sites (ca 7.011.0 mM). Methane was not detected at the Mt Crushmore site, but ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 mM at the other sites.

AB  - The deep pelagic habitat is a vast volume of cold, dark water where food is scarce and bioluminescence is the principal source of light and communication. Understanding the adaptations that allow animals to successfully inhabit this daunting realm has been a difficult challenge because investigators have had to conduct their work remotely. Research in the deep water column is going through an essential transformation from indirect to direct methods as undersea vehicles provide unprecedented access, new capabilities, and new perspectives. Traditional methods have accurately documented the meso- and macro-scale zoogeographic patterns of micronekton and zooplankton, as well as their distribution and migration patterns in the vertical plane. The new in situ technologies have enabled advances in studies of behavior, physiology, and in particular, the role of gelatinous animals in deep pelagic ecology. These discoveries reveal a deep-water fauna that is complex and diverse and still very poorly known. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The mesopelagic zone is the oceanic region through which carbon and other elements must pass in order to reach deeper waters or the sea floor. However, the food web interactions that occur in the mesopelagic zone are difficult to measure and so, despite their crucial importance to global elemental cycles, are not very well known. Recent developments in technology and new approaches have advanced the study of the variability in and controls upon the distribution and diversity of organisms in the mesopelagic zone, including the roles of respiration, recycling, and repackaging of particulate and dissolved organic material. However, there are remarkably few syntheses of the ecology and biogeochemistry of the microbes and metazoa that permanently reside or habitually visit this 'twilight zone'. Without this synthesis, it is difficult to assess the impact of ongoing changes in ocean hydrography and chemistry, due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, on the biological carbon pump. This paper reviews what is known about the distribution of microbes and metazoa in the mesopelagic zone in relation to their activity and impact on global biogeochemical cycles. Thus, gaps in our knowledge are identified and suggestions made for priority research programmes that will improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on carbon sequestration. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In many oceanic carbon budgets there is a discrepancy between the energetic requirements of deep-sea benthic communities and the supply of organic matter. This suggests that there are unidentified and unmeasured food sources reaching the seafloor. During 11 deep-sea remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys in the Gulf of California, the remains (squid carcasses and hatched-out egg sheets) of 64 post-brooding squid were encountered. As many as 36 remains were encountered during a single dive. To our knowledge this is one of the largest numbers of natural food falls of medium-size deep-sea nekton described to date. Various deep-sea scavengers (Ophiuroidea, Holothuroidea, Decapoda, Asteroidea, Enteropneusta) were associated with the remains. Although many of the 80 examined ROV dives did not encounter dead squids or egg sheets (n = 69), and the phenomenon may be geographically and temporally restricted, our results show that dead, sinking squid transport carbon from the water column to the seafloor in the Gulf of California. Based on food fall observations from individual dives, we estimate that annual squid carcass depositions may regionally contribute from 0.05 to 12.07 mg C m-2 d-1 to the seafloor in the areas where we observed the remains. The sinking of squid carcasses may constitute a significant but underestimated carbon vector between the water column and the seafloor worldwide, because squid populations are enormous and are regionally expanding as a result of climate change and pressure on fish stocks. In the future, standardized methods and surveys in geographical regions that have large squid populations will be important for investigating the overall contribution of squid falls to regional carbon budgets.

AB  - © 2017 Neufeld et al. Species-area relationships (SARs) are among the most general patterns in nature. Yet, significant variation in species richness often remains after accounting for area, especially for small islands. One factor thought to influence species richness on small islands is disturbance from the combined influence of tides and waves. Here, we derive a quantitative framework for determining how ocean disturbance impacts island communities, which we then test in plant communities in a temperate island archipelago. We do so by applying some well-developed techniques honed in the marine intertidal zone but rarely applied to studies on land. By estimating and adjusting for the effect of wave exposure on habitable island area, we dramatically improved the fit of the SAR for small islands, nearly doubling the amount of variation in species richness explained (from 37% to 69%). Our predictions of island occupancy also improved using this method. Our approach predicts that small islands ( < 100,000 m) are the most affected by ocean-borne disturbance. Given that many archipelagos are susceptible to wave disturbance, future studies should consider how ocean-borne disturbances arising from the matrix might interact with sampling area to influence patterns of species richness on small islands.

AB  - We used the extirpation, reintroduction, and spread of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) along the west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada, to evaluate how the otter-urchin-algae trophic cascade creates variation in rocky reef community structure over space and time. By repeatedly sampling both randomly selected and permanently marked sites in areas where sea otters were continuously present, continuously absent, or became reestablished during a 23-year study period, we found a highly predictable association between community phase states (algae abundant or urchins abundant) and the population status of sea otters. In areas where sea otters were continuously present, urchins were rare and algae dominated, whereas in areas where otters were continuously absent, urchins were abundant and algae were rare. Despite this predictability, the species composition and abundance of algae within otter-dominated sites and the abundance of urchins in otter-free sites were spatially and temporally variable. The transition from the urchin-dominated to algal-dominated phase state, brought about by sea otters preying on sea urchins, was documented; at some sites the transition occurred rapidly, whereas at other sites a short-lived transitional state composed of algal-urchin mosaics occurred. We experimentally demonstrate that this mosaic forms when living urchins flee from the damaged tests of conspecifics that are discarded by foraging sea otters, and kelp recruits into the urchin-free patches. Thus, although the phase state dynamics appeared to be stable and predictable based upon the presence or absence of sea otters, we found that spatial and asynchronous temporal variation in recruitment, mortality demography, succession, and prey behavior led to differences in the abundance and/or composition of species within the two phase states.

AB  - Kelp (. Laminaria hyperborea (Gunn.) Foslie) forests support a diverse community of invertebrates. The aim of the present study was to test if the abundance, diversity (measured as average species number) and community structure of macrofauna associated with epiphytic algae on kelp stipes depend on physical stress from wave surge and habitat diversity, or if differences simply result from differences in habitat size. Results show that faunal diversity increased with wave exposure, mainly due to increasing wave stress and habitat diversity. Abundance was highest at medium wave exposed stations, and lowest at low exposure stations. However, the habitat structural diversity is high in kelp forests regardless of wave exposure, and a typical kelp forest fauna is associated with functional groups of epiphytic algae across different levels of wave exposure. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This chapter deals with large marine plants, specifically the benthically attached algaes (seaweeds) and sea grasses. Our knowledge of marine plants on the British Columbia (BC) coast is dominated by two species of kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana and Macrocystis integrifolia) and eelgrass (esp. Zostera marina). This is partially because these species are so common, but more importantly, these species form essential habitat for a huge number of other organisms including birds, invertebrates, and both juvenile and adult fish as well as providing much of the substrate for herring spawn. As habitat, these species form a critical component of ecosystem function in the nearshore. Kelp surveys have been done for a number of areas along BC’s coast, but are rarely repeated, so temporal change is not well understood. There is evidence that Macrocystis increases in abundance relative to Nereocystis when sea surface temperatures increase, as they have been over the last 30 to 50 years. The effect of this global-warming-related change on the ecosystem is not known. Eelgrass beds are extremely sensitive to environmental change. So much so that in many cases of eelgrass decline, it is not possible to determine which environmental change was the ultimate cause. In terms of biodiversity, there are hundreds of known species of marine plants in the Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA, Figure E.0) (Johannessen et al. 2005; Sloan and Bartier 2000). Current data is insufficient to determine if this biodiversity is changing with time.

AB  - Classic marine ecological paradigms view kelp forests as inherently temperate-boreal phenomena replaced by coral reefs in tropical waters. These paradigms hinge on the notion that tropical surface waters are too warm and nutrient-depleted to support kelp productivity and survival. We present a synthetic oceanographic and ecophysiological model that accurately identifies all known kelp populations and, by using the same criteria, predicts the existence of >23,500 km(2) unexplored submerged (30- to 200-m depth) tropical kelp habitats. Predicted tropical kelp habitats were most probable in regions where bathymetry and upwelling resulted in mixed-layer shoaling above the depth of minimum annual irradiance dose for kelp survival. Using model predictions, we discovered extensive new deep-water Eisenia galapagensis populations in the Galápagos that increased in abundance with increasing depth to >60 m, complete with cold-water flora and fauna of temperate affinities. The predictability of deep-water kelp habitat and the discovery of expansive deep-water Galápagos kelp forests validate the extent of deep-water tropical kelp refugia, with potential implications for regional productivity and biodiversity, tropical food web ecology, and understanding of the resilience of tropical marine systems to climate change.

AB  - Kelp forests, highly diverse cold water communities organized around the primary productivity and physical structure provided by members of the Laminariales, support a variety of fisheries, and the kelp itself is harvested for alginates. Worldwide, these communities generally share susceptibility to destructive overgrazing by sea urchins. The impact of sea-urchin grazing is governed by the ratio between food availability and grazing pressure, thus factors affecting the abundance of both urchins and kelps are central to ecosystem integrity. Some kelp ecosystems share a second generality, the association of exploitation of various urchin predators with destructive levels of urchin grazing, leading to cascading implications for other species dependent on the productivity and habitat provided by the kelps. Competition between abalones and sea urchins also affects some kelp communities. These ecosystem-structuring processes are complicated by a variety of bottom-up and top-down factors, including variability in ocean climate affecting kelp productivity and recruitment of key species, and echinoid disease. Potential ecosystem effects of fisheries for predators, abalones, sea urchins, and kelps are reviewed biogeographically. Given the hundreds to thousands of years that many nearshore marine ecosystems have been exploited, no-take marine reserves may be the only way to determine the true ecosystem effects of fishing.

AB  - The importance of habitat size for abundances of meio- and macrofauna inhabiting epiphytic algae on kelp Laminaria hyperborea was tested. One, two or three artificial substrates consisting of rope and fish net were added to natural kelp plants in in situ manipulation experiments. After two months, the abundances of dominant macrofauna groups correlated with habitat size. The same relationship between faunal abundance and habitat size was found at two sites and in two consecutive years. No clear correlations were found between abundances of the dominant meiofaunal groups and habitat size. Thus, there appear to be differences in the use of habitats by macro- and meiofauna: while habitat size seems to be important for abundances of macrofauna, other factors seem to control abundances of meiofauna. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These dimensions were emphasized to different degrees and tended to vary in oppositional manners according to the type of course. Our results can assist college faculty who seek to become better teachers, and reassure those who have been disappointed in their endeavors that receiving poor evaluations does not always or necessarily reflect poor teaching methods.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are centrally important to the biology of the planet, yet a comprehensive understanding of how anthropogenic climate change is affecting them has been poorly developed. Recent studies indicate that rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations are driving ocean systems toward conditions not seen for millions of years, with an associated risk of fundamental and irreversible ecological transformation. The impacts of anthropogenic climate change so far include decreased ocean productivity, altered food web dynamics, reduced abundance of habitat-forming species, shifting species distributions, and a greater incidence of disease. Although there is considerable uncertainty about the spatial and temporal details, climate change is clearly and fundamentally altering ocean ecosystems. Further change will continue to create enormous challenges and costs for societies worldwide, particularly those in developing countries.

AB  - The rate of input of new individuals into communities is a key component of community dynamics. Detection of ecosystem responsiveness to climatic perturbations such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) can provide insight into how ecosystems will respond to climate change. Although these climate patterns are ocean-based, understanding of their influences on key ecosystem processes in temperate coastal marine ecosystems is limited. Recent analyses documented orders-of-magnitude increases in mussel recruitment in the 2000s relative to the previous decade. To evaluate the generality of this pattern across other intertidal species with planktotrophic dispersive larvae, and determine the extent to which variation in recruitment was explained by climatic and environmental (upwelling) variation, we analyzed patterns of barnacle and mussel recruitment across space (at up to 10 sites across 250. km) and through time (up to 20-years). Compared to mussel recruitment, barnacle recruitment varied far less interdecadally, and showed minimal change in seasonality. Using three analytical approaches, multiple regression, quantile regression and wavelet analysis, we found that recruitment of the barnacles Balanus glandula and Chthamalus dalli and mussels Mytilus spp. varied in generally similar ways with climate variation as expressed in ENSO, NPGO, and PDO indices, and with upwelling, as expressed in the Bakun upwelling index. In regression approaches, NPGO and upwelling had the strongest associations with recruitment of all species, with MEI and PDO also having an influence on C. dalli. The strength of the association with the environment varied with recruitment magnitude, however, being generally stronger at intermediate and in some cases high recruitment densities and weak at low recruitment densities. Time series (wavelet) analysis showed that with all environmental indices, the most consistent strong relationships occurred at annual periodicities, but multi-year periodicities were also important with PDO and upwelling indices. Patterns were complex, however, with periods of strong and weak associations at different time periodicities varying differently among the different environmental measures, and in some cases varying from strongly positive to strongly negative associations at the same periodicities through time. These relatively consistent relationships between large-scale climate and upwelling, and recruitment explained a substantial fraction of the variance (37-40%). The ~. 60% of the variance in recruitment not explained in our analyses is likely due to myriad other factors such as shorter-scale variation in upwelling, internal tidal bores, sea breezes, wave forces, larval behavior, and post-settlement processes. Thus, our analysis adds insights into potential influences on recruitment that occur at ocean basin- to regional scales, and complements the body of work that focuses on the more local-scale and shorter-term mechanistic influences that also help determine the pace at which larvae recruit to the adult habitat. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Considerable intraspecific variation exists in responses to habitat fragmentation owing to regional differences in fragment quality. Habitat use and activity patterns of resident populations are related to the abundance and predictability of resources in time and space, and thus space use is one of the most important considerations for evaluating habitat quality. Here I examine inter- and intrasite differences in the ranging behavior; use of the matrix, i.e., surrounding nonhabitat; and activity budgets of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) inhabiting two forest fragments-Anja Special Reserve and Tsaranoro Valley Sacred Forest-in Madagascar's central highlands to test the prediction that intraspecific variation in habitat use and activity patterns is indicative of fragment quality. At Anja, Lemur catta has access to abundant year-round anthropogenic resources (introduced fruit trees, agricultural crops, water), whereas the population at Tsaranoro relies on seasonally variable and patchily distributed resources throughout the forest and matrix. Lemur catta at Anja occupy smaller home ranges; have shorter daily path lengths (DPLs); and spend less time foraging and more time resting, locomoting, and engaging in social and territorial behavior. In contrast, groups at Tsaranoro occupy larger home ranges, have longer DPLs, rely heavily on the matrix, and expend most of their energy in foraging behavior. These differences point to variation in the relative habitat quality of the two fragments and are thus an important consideration for conservation managers when assessing the capacity of forest fragments to sustain populations.

AB  - Landscape modification and habitat fragmentation are key drivers of global species loss. Their effects may be understood by focusing on: (1) individual species and the processes threatening them, and (2) human-perceived landscape patterns and their correlation with species and assemblages. Individual species may decline as a result of interacting exogenous and endogenous threats, including habitat loss, habitat degradation, habitat isolation, changes in the biology, behaviour, and interactions of species, as well as additional, stochastic threats. Human-perceived landscape patterns that are frequently correlated with species assemblages include the amount and structure of native vegetation, the prevalence of anthropogenic edges, the degree of landscape connectivity, and the structure and heterogeneity of modified areas. Extinction cascades are particularly likely to occur in landscapes with low native vegetation cover, low landscape connectivity, degraded native vegetation and intensive land use in modified areas, especially if keystone species or entire functional groups of species are lost. This review (1) demonstrates that species-oriented and pattern- oriented approaches to understanding the ecology of modified landscapes are highly complementary, (2) clarifies the links between a wide range of interconnected themes, and (3) provides clear and consistent terminology. Tangible research and management priorities are outlined that are likely to benefit the conservation of native species in modified landscapes around the world. Keywords

AB  - Data are presented from pilot studies as the first step in the design of large-scale surveys of the effects of human recreational activities on intertidal habitats in New South Wales. People visiting the seashore were counted and interviewed. Numbers of organisms removed for food or bait were determined, as were the numbers of fishermen and scavengers frequenting the shore. Data from pilot studies using these methods assessed the various effects of human recreation during school terms or holidays, on week-days or week-ends and on sunny or overcast days. Pilot sampling at different locations provided estimates of the variability from place to place within 30 km. Sampling was in a fully orthogonal design which allowed tests of various factors and their interactions. More people affected the shore during school holidays than during term-time, but there were no differences between week-ends and week-days. There were significant effects due to weather, with more potential impact occurring on sunny than on overcast days. There were also substantial differences in effects at different places. Other potential sources of variation which should be considered in designing surveys of the effects of human recreation are briefly considered. These include variability due to time of day, the state of the tide, prevailing weather and various spatial and temporal scales. Such pilot sampling enables the efficient design of the large-scale, long-term surveys that are a necessary prerequisite to determining the magnitude and effects of human disturbances and their eventual management.

AB  - Effective conservation requires addressing three fundamental questions whose answers can only be sought in conservation practice: (1) What should our goals be and how do we measure progress in reaching them? (2) How can we most effectively take action to achieve conservation? and (3) How can we learn to do conservation better? This essay provides a conceptual framework and research agenda for a conservation science that uses the principles of adaptive management to answer these questions. The framework is based on a general model of a conservation project. The conservation target involves defining the specific area or population the project is trying to influence. This target is affected by direct and indirect threats and opportunities; we provide a table of potential direct threats. Conservation actions that are taken to counter these threats can be divided into approaches, strategies, and specific tools; we present a comprehensive table of potential approaches. Finally, the practicioners that take these actions include individuals, organizations, project alliances, and networks; we define the specific functional roles necessary to achieve effective adaptive management. We then use this framework to outline a research agenda for conservation science that involves defining clear and practical measures of conservation success, determining sound guiding principles for using conservation strategies and tools, and developing the knowledge and skills in individuals and organizations for good adaptive management and thus for making conservation more effective.

AB  - Science communication is seen as critical for the disciplines of ecology and conservation, where research products are often used to shape policy and decision making. Scientists are increasing their online media communication, via social media and news. Such media engagement has been thought to influence or predict traditional metrics of scholarship, such as citation rates. Here, we measure the association between citation rates and the Altmetric Attention Score—an indicator of the amount and reach of the attention an article has received—along with other forms of bibliometric performance (year published, journal impact factor, and article type). We found that Attention Score was positively correlated with citation rates. However, in recent years, we detected increasing media exposure did not relate to the equivalent citations as in earlier years; signalling a diminishing return on investment. Citations correlated with journal impact factors up to ∼13, but then plateaued, demonstrating that maximizing citations does not require publishing in the highest-impact journals. We conclude that ecology and conservation researchers can increase exposure of their research through social media engagement and, simultaneously, enhance their performance under traditional measures of scholarly activity.

AB  - Bacterial chondroitinase ABC (ChaseABC) has been used to remove the inhibitory chondroitin sulfate chains from chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans to improve regeneration after rodent spinal cord injury. We hypothesized that the mammalian enzyme arylsulfatase B (ARSB) would also enhance recovery after mouse spinal cord injury. Application of the mammalian enzyme would be an attractive alternative to ChaseABC because of its more robust chemical stability and reduced immunogenicity. A one-time injection of human ARSB into injured mouse spinal cord eliminated immunoreactivity for chondroitin sulfates within five days, and up to 9 weeks after injury. After a moderate spinal cord injury, we observed improvements of locomotor recovery assessed by the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) in ARSB treated mice, compared to the buffer-treated control group, at 6 weeks after injection. After a severe spinal cord injury, mice injected with equivalent units of ARSB or ChaseABC improved similarly and both groups achieved significantly more locomotor recovery than the buffer-treated control mice. Serotonin and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive axons were more extensively present in mouse spinal cords treated with ARSB and ChaseABC, and the immunoreactive axons penetrated further beyond the injury site in ARSB or ChaseABC treated mice than in control mice. These results indicate that mammalian ARSB improves functional recovery after CNS injury. The structural/molecular mechanisms underlying the observed functional improvement remain to be elucidated.

AB  - Increased farm salmon production has heightened concerns about the association between disease on farm and wild fish. The controversy is particularly evident in the Broughton Archipelago of Western Canada, where a high prevalence of sea lice (ectoparasitic copepods) was first reported on juvenile wild pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in 2001. Exposure to sea lice from farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was thought to be the cause of the 97% population decline before these fish returned to spawn in 2002, although no diagnostic investigation was done to rule out other causes of mortality. To address the concern that sea lice from fish farms would cause population extinction of wild salmon, we analyzed 10-20 y of fish farm data and 60 y of pink salmon data. We show that the number of pink salmon returning to spawn in the fall predicts the number of female sea lice on farm fish the next spring, which, in turn, accounts for 98% of the annual variability in the prevalence of sea lice on outmigrating wild juvenile salmon. However, productivity of wild salmon is not negatively associated with either farm lice numbers or farm fish production, and all published field and laboratory data support the conclusion that something other than sea lice caused the population decline in 2002. We conclude that separating farm salmon from wild salmon--proposed through coordinated fallowing or closed containment--will not increase wild salmon productivity and that medical analysis can improve our understanding of complex issues related to aquaculture sustainability.

AB  - Marine salmon farming has been correlated with parasitic sea lice infestations and concurrent declines of wild salmonids. Here, we report a quantitative analysis of how a single salmon farm altered the natural transmission dynamics of sea lice to juvenile Pacific salmon. We studied infections of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi) on juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) as they passed an isolated salmon farm during their seaward migration down two long and narrow corridors. Our calculations suggest the infection pressure imposed by the farm was four orders of magnitude greater than ambient levels, resulting in a maximum infection pressure near the farm that was 73 times greater than ambient levels and exceeded ambient levels for 30 km along the two wild salmon migration corridors. The farm-produced cohort of lice parasitizing the wild juvenile hosts reached reproductive maturity and produced a second generation of lice that re-infected the juvenile salmon. This raises the infection pressure from the farm by an additional order of magnitude, with a composite infection pressure that exceeds ambient levels for 75 km of the two migration routes. Amplified sea lice infestations due to salmon farms are a potential limiting factor to wild salmonid conservation.

AB  - This study compared sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) infestation rates on juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon in five nearshore areas of the British Columbia coast selected on the basis of proximity to salmon farms. A 10-week study in the Broughton Archipelago found sea lice were 8.8 times more abundant on wild fish near farms holding adult salmon and 5.0 times more abundant on wild fish near farms holding smolts than in areas distant from salmon farms. We found that 90% of juvenile pink and chum salmon sampled near salmon farms in the Broughton Archipelago were infected with more than 1.6 lice·(g host mass)1, a proposed lethal limit when the lice reach mobile stages. Sea lice abundance was near zero in all areas without salmon farms. Salinity and temperature differences could not account for the higher infestation rates near the fish farms. The most immature life stages dominated the lice population throughout the study, suggesting the source of lice was a statio...

AB  - Industrial salmon farming has been correlated with infestations of parasitic sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis in adjacent wild juvenile salmonids and declines of sympatric wild salmonid populations. Prohibitively large financial, human, and logistical resource requirements prevent the implementation of long-term, large-scale monitoring programs to assess the effect of farms on wild salmonids. We report a novel nonlethal sampling procedure for quantifying louse abundances and measures of fish health on wild juvenile pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha and chum salmon O. keta during their early marine life history phase. The method significantly reduces the resource requirements of sampling programs and provides a desirable nonlethal alternative for studying depressed or threatened populations. The simplicity of the protocol facilitates public participation, further decreasing costs while increasing the potential spatiotemporal coverage and resolution of future research–monitoring programs.

AB  - The sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, is an ecto-parasitic copepod of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., capable of causing severe damage. This study was conducted to examine the physiological re-sponse of salmon to the stress of sea lice infesta-tion. Smoltified salmon were acclimatized in 30‰ saltwater and exposed to high levels of lice infesta-tion. The number of copepods per fish ranged from 15 to 285, with a mean of 106. The infested salmon were sampled six times over the 29-d experimental duration and examined for alterations in the primary and secondary stress indicators, including plasma concentrations of cortisol, glu-cose, electrolytes, thyroid hormones T 3 and T 4 , as well as the haematocrit level. The results were examined for correlations between the stress indica-tors, the number of copepods per fish and the life stage of the copepods. The presence of L. salmonis elevated stress indicators in relation to the specific sea lice stage. By day 21, both cortisol (mean 63.1 nmol L −1 controls: 179.8 nmol L −1 for para-sitized) and glucose (mean 3.545 mmol L −1 con-trols: 4.567 mmol L −1 for parasitized) levels were significantly increased due to the presence of the lice. This was believed to be a direct result of the sea lice development into the larger life stages, thus increasing the level of host damage.

AB  - Salmon may sense and respond to a range of environmental variables within sea-cages, including light, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, water currents and certain chemical treatments used during production. Environments within sea-cages are typically highly variable in both space and time, with the greatest variation occurring with depth. Preferred swimming depths and densities of salmon are the result of active trade-offs among environmental influences and an array of internal motivational factors such as feed and perceived threats. When preferred levels of multiple environmental cues exist at different depths, behavioural responses to temperature, light, the entry of feed, oxygen levels or the presence of treatment chemicals may dominate and override behavioural responses to all other drivers and determine swimming depths. Behavioural trade-offs in response to environmental drivers typically result in schooling at specific depths within sea-cages at densities 1.5 to 5 times their stocked density, and up to 20 times in extreme cases. Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of key environmental variables within sea-cages and how salmon respond to them may enable modifications to sea-cage environments to improve welfare outcomes, feeding regimes, artificial light management strategies and the efficacy of sea-lice treatments. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - So far throughout this book we have championed the view that natural selection designs individuals to behave in their own selfish interests and not for the good of their species or for the good of the group in which they live. For example, observed clutch size, foraging behaviour and mating patterns are what would be expected if selection optimized behaviour and life history strategies to maximize an individual's reproductive success. However, it will be obvious to any naturalist that animals do not behave selfishly all the time. Often individuals apparently cooperate with others. Several lions may cooperate to hunt prey; in many species of birds and mammals individuals give alarm calls to warn others of the approach of a predator; in many cooperative breeding species, such as meerkats, an individual may help others to produce offspring rather than have young itself. In some cases, cooperation provides an immediate or delayed benefit to the survival or reproduction of the actor, that outweighs the cost of performing the behaviour. For example, one individual may help another because that individual will then help it back. In this case, cooperation is mutually beneficial and can be explained by selfish interests, as is discussed in further detail in the next chapter. In other cases, and more troubling for evolutionary theory, cooperative behaviours provide no benefit to the actor and are altruistic. Specifically, a behaviour is defined as altruistic if it is costly to the personal reproduction of the actor who performs that behaviour, but beneficial to another individual or individuals (Box 11.1). For example, in the social insects, the ants, bees, wasps and termites, the workers are often sterile, giving up any opportunity to reproduce, in order to help raise the offspring of the queen. If natural selection favours individuals that behave in their own selfish interests, how can we explain such altruistic helping behaviours? To understand how natural selection can lead to altruistic, and even spiteful behaviours, we have to return to the fundamental issue of exactly how natural selection works at the genetic level.

AB  - The ecological risks of salmon aquaculture have motivated changes to management and policy designed to protect wild salmon populations and habitats in several countries. In Canada, much attention has focused on outbreaks of parasitic copepods, sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), on farmed and wild salmon in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia. Several recent studies have reached contradictory conclusions on whether the spread of lice from salmon farms affects the productivity of sympatric wild salmon populations. We analyzed recently available sea lice data on farms and spawner-recruit data for pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon populations in the Broughton Archipelago and nearby regions where farms are not present. Our results show that sea lice abundance on farms is negatively associated with productivity of both pink and coho salmon in the Broughton Archipelago. These results reconcile the contradictory findings of previous studies and suggest that management and policy measures designed to protect wild salmon from sea lice should yield conservation and fishery benefits.

AB  - The physiological effects of salmon lice infections on post-smolt of Atlantic salmon were examined by experimentally infecting hatchery reared post-smolts with infective copepodids. Even at high infection intensities, ranging from 30–250 lice per fish, early chalimus stages did not have severe, physiological effects on the fish. There was a sudden increase in fish mortality after the appearance of preadult I stages. Infected fish were then suffering due to lesions and osmoregulatory failure. Plasma chloride level increased significantly and total protein, albumin and haematocrit decreased significantly in infected compared to uninfected fish. All infected fish became moribund before adult lice appeared. Infection intensities above 30 salmon lice larvae per fish thus appear to cause death of Atlantic salmon post-smolt soon after the lice reach their pre-adult stage.

AB  - Ectoparasitic sea lice are the most important parasite problem to date for the salmon farming industry in the northern and southern hemispheres. An understanding of host location in the specialist species, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, the most important louse species in the North Atlantic, is now being realized using behavioural in vitro and in vivo bioassays coupled with chemical analysis of fish conditioned waters. Both physical and chemical cues are important in host location. Responses of sea lice to physical cues such as light and salinity may enable them to gather in areas where host fish are likely to be found. Mechanoreception is an important sensory modality in host location and acts by switching on specific behaviours that enable landing on a fish. Chemoreception plays a defining role in host location and recognition. The detection of host kairomones switches on 'host search' behavioural patterns and also induces landing responses whereas non-host kairomones fail to induce attraction or significant landing behaviour. Semiochemicals derived from salmon and also non-host fish have been identified, and may prove useful for the development of integrated pest management strategies, by the introduction of odour traps for monitoring lice numbers, and by the use of stimulo-deterrent diversionary (push:pull) strategies in their control.

AB  - Sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) are a significant source of monetary losses on salmon farms. Sea lice exhibit temperature-dependent development rates and salinity-dependent mortality, but to date no deterministic models have incorporated these seasonally varying factors. To understand how environmental variation and life history characteristics affect sea lice abundance, we derive a delay differential equation model and parameterize the model with environmental data from British Columbia and southern Newfoundland. We calculate the lifetime reproductive output for female sea lice maturing to adulthood at different times of the year and find differences in the timing of peak reproduction between the two regions. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that sea lice abundance is more sensitive to variation in mean annual water temperature and mean annual salinity than to variation in life history parameters. Our results suggest that effective sea lice management requires consideration of site-specific temperature and salinity patterns and, in particular, that the optimal timing of production cycles and sea lice treatments might vary between regions.

AB  - A major challenge for Atlantic salmon farming in the northern hemisphere is infestation by the sea louse parasite Lepeophtheirus salmonis. The most frequent method of controlling these sea louse infestations is through the use of chemical treatments. However, most major salmon farming areas have observed resistance to common chemotherapeutants. In terrestrial environments, many strategies employed to manage the evolution of resistance involve the use of refugia, where a portion of the population is left untreated to maintain susceptibility. While refugia have not been deliberately used in Atlantic salmon farming, wild salmon populations that migrate close to salmon farms may act as natural refugia. In this paper we describe an agent-based model that explores the influence of different sizes of wild salmon populations on resistance evolution in sea lice on a salmon farm. Using the model, we demonstrate that wild salmon populations can act as refugia that limit the evolution of resistance in the sea louse populations. Additionally, we demonstrate that an increase in the size of the population of wild salmon results in an increased effect in slowing the evolution of resistance. We explore the effect of a population fitness cost associated with resistance, finding that in some cases it substantially reduces the speed of evolution to chemical treatments.

AB  - Within the literature, most discussion of sampling protocols for monitoring aquatic parasites is based on the assumptions of simple random sampling. Recent research has shown that in monitoring parasite abundance on fish farms composed of discrete cages, care must be taken to properly account for the clustering which naturally occurs. This paper illustrates the effect of clustering in the context of monitoring ectoparasitic sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus elongatus in salmon farms. The degree of clustering of sea lice infections in fish within cages is measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A wide range of ICC values from sites in Scotland and Norway were estimated for the chalimus and mobile stages of L. salmonis, and for C. elongatus mobiles. The analyses indicate that significant clustering of lice infections within cages occurs across lice species and stages on both Scottish and Norwegian farms. A Monte-Carlo simulation using two sets of data from Scottish farms with ICC values for adult L. salmonis of 0.35 [0.08-0.73, 95% CI] and for adult C. elongatus of 0.39 [0.16-0.69, 95% CI] were used to illustrate the implications of clustering. The protocols simulated reflect those typically used across a range of countries and production environments in which salmon are currently reared. The findings demonstrate that the "few fish from many cages" approach results in a marked improvement in precision when sampling aquatic one-host parasites in cage-based production systems. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Intensity and distribution of presettlement by the copepodid of the sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, on smolts of its host Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, were quantified for 27 infection regimes under controlled flume conditions. Each infection regime represented a level of interaction between three levels (low, medium, high) of the physical factors of light (10, 300, 800 lx), salinity (20e, 27e, 35e), and host velocity (0.2, 7.0, 15.0 cm center dot s(-1)). Light, salinity, and host velocity independently and interactively determined the distribution and number of presettled copepodids on hosts. Host surface area also influenced the number of attached preestablished copepodids. The distribution of presettled copepodids on the host body surface closely corresponded to that of settled copepodids and chalimi reported from other studies, with the greatest levels observed on the fins, in particular the dorsal, caudal, and pectoral fins. Copepodid presettlement occurred on the gills under all conditions. Differential presettlement, not selective mortality, probably produces the distribution pattern of settled stages seen in other studies.

AB  - The development of behavioural bioassays and electrophysiological recording techniques has enabled the role of semiochemicals to be investigated for the first time in Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Krøyer). Adult male sea lice L salmonis were activated by, and attracted to, salmon-conditioned water (SCW) and SCW extract. Non-host fish odours, turbot-conditioned water (TCW) and turbot-conditioned water extract (TCW extract), elicited activation but no attraction in the lice. Solid-phase extraction techniques were developed to extract low molecular weight components of fish odours, and biological activity was shown to be confined to these. Electrophysiological activity from aesthetascs in the first antennae was found and neural responses to odours were recorded from the antennal nerves. Preliminary experiments on individual chemicals (isophorone, 1-octen-3-ol) linked to salmon revealed behavioural activation and electrophysiological responses in adult male L salmonis. Isophorone was shown to be significantly attractive to sea lice when placed in a slow-release system in a perfused tank of seawater in a choice situation. Proof of concept has been established for successfully extracting odour cues from seawater, analysing their biological activity and applying these to slow-release technologies for field trapping of lice. Future work involving linked GC-MS techniques using behaviour, electrophysiological responses, and organolepsis will establish further host location cues specific to Atlantic salmon.

AB  - The variation in Lepeophtheirus salmonis sea lice numbers across 40 Scottish salmon farm sites during 1996 to 2000 was analysed using mean mobile abundance for 3 important 6 mo periods within the production cycle. Using statistical regression techniques, over 20 management and environmental variables suspected to have an effect on controlling lice populations were investigated as potential risk factors. The findings and models developed provide a picture of mobile L. salmonis infestation patterns on Scottish farm sites collectively. The results identified level of treatment, type of treatment, cage volume, current speed, loch flushing time and sea lice levels in the preceding 6 mo period to be key explanatory factors. Factors such as stocking density, site biomass, water temperature and the presence of neighbours, previously cited to be important correlates of sea lice risk from analysis of individual sites over time, were not found to be important. Variation in mobile abundance in the first half of the second year of production could be adequately explained (adjusted R2 between 55 and 72%) by the recorded data, suggesting that there is scope for management to control L. salmonis abundance, though much of the variation remains unexplained.

AB  - Two field studies were carried out with farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in sea cages to examine various effects of artificial light (AL) and the vertical distribution of salmon on lice infestation. The use of AL light caused an overall increase in lice infestation in both experiments. The first study showed that salmon held at 0-4 m depth in cages developed higher infestation than salmon held at greater depths (4-8 and 8-12 m) under both natural light (NL) and AL. In the second study, salmon maintained in 14-m deep sea cages that were exposed to AL with different light intensities. The AL treatments resulted directly in different diel and seasonal patterns of vertical distribution of the salmon and also different temporal patterns in lice infestations. So indirectly the infestation pattern appeared to be correlated with median day-time swimming depth of the salmon. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since about 1880, the eggs and sperm of sea urchins have been used for the study of fertilization, the metabolic activation of development and gene regulatory mechanisms governing embryogenesis. Sea urchin gametes are a favorite material for observations of the process of fertilization in advanced high school, community college, and university biology laboratory courses. This article is a laboratory handout, designed for the student to follow in learning about fertilization. In addition to observations of sperm-egg interaction, simple experiments are described that demonstrate some mechanisms involved in the process. The hope is that by making simple observations of fertilization, the student will gain an appreciation for the fact that successive generations of higher organisms are bridged by the fusion of egg and sperm, two very different single cells.

AB  - Copepods are a class of small crustaceans that are widespread and naturally abundant in all aquatic ecosystems as a key link between primary producers and higher predators. They have 13 distinct life stages (i.e., egg, six naupliar stages, five copepodite stages, adult), making development easy to trace, and many species are sexually dimorphic. These life-history traits and its importance in the aquatic food web make copepods a suitable candidate as reference organisms for ecotoxicology. Copepods are used particularly for full life-cycle toxicity evaluation. This potential is recognized by researchers, government agencies, and international bodies. This chapter provides a summary of the current state of science in copepod toxicity testing, published protocols of copepod tests, and identifies key research area for further development of copepod testing.

AB  - Measurements on cultivated larvae and data from the literature demonstrate that length and width of pelagic sea lice larvae, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus elongalus, are overlapping. Therefore measurements on planktonic developmental stages are of little practical value in specific identification. A standard WP-2 net with 200-mum mesh size will, in practice, collect free living sea lice larvae satisfactorily. The naupliar and copepodid stages of sea lice are illustrated and pigment distribution described. Larvae of L. salmonis are characterized by black and brown pigment, those of C. elongatus by red. The distributions of pigment are distinctive in the species mentioned, and in pelagic larvae of Lepeophtheirus pollachius and L. pectoralis which also are measured, described and illustrated for comparison. The copepodid stages of larvae are different in shape of pro- and urosome, morphology and armature of the maxilliped, distribution of pigment and its colour. The black and brown pigmented copepodid of L. salmonis is slender and oval in outline, somewhat pointed anteriorly, broadest in the middle of prosome and more narrow posteriorly. The proximal segment of the maxilliped is robust without seta, but the subehela has a slender branching barb with three to five 'fingers'. The red pigmented prosome of C. elongatus is clongate, broad anteriorly with two lateral notches. The extreme breadth of the copepodid is clearly before the middle of the prosome. The corpus of the maxilliped is elongate and equipped with a seta. In addition the appendage has a medial 2-divided process.

AB  - Concern about climate change has re-ignited interest in universal ecological responses to temperature variations: (1) biogeographical shifts, (2) phenology changes, and (3) size shifts. In this study we used copepods as model organisms to study size responses to temperature because of their central role in the pelagic food web and because of the ontogenetic length constancy between molts, which facilitates the definition of size of distinct developmental stages. In order to test the expected temperature-induced shifts towards smaller body size and lower abundances under warming conditions, a mesocosm experiment using plankton from the Baltic Sea at three temperature levels (ambient, ambient +4 °C, ambient -4 °C) was performed in summer 2010. Overall copepod and copepodit abundances, copepod size at all life stages, and adult copepod size in particular, showed significant temperature effects. As expected, zooplankton peak abundance was lower in warm than in ambient treatments. Copepod size-at-immature stage significantly increased in cold treatments, while adult size significantly decreased in warm treatments.

AB  - The Scaphopoda are marine infaunal carnivores that feed on foraminiferans and other microorganisms selected and manipulated by their unique feeding tentacles or captacula. Their tusk-like shell is open at both ends; the burrowing foot and captacula protrude anteriorly, while respiratory currents pass through the posterior opening. Although the scaphopods comprise one of the smallest molluskan classes in terms of species diversity, they have a worldwide distribution ranging from intertidal to depths in excess of 6000 m. Despite detailed monographic work from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, however, the biology of scaphopods is today among the least understood of mollusks. To some extent, this is related to a significant departure from more typical molluscan organization inferred from studies of the larger classes. For example, the mantle cavity is elongate and restricted in space, and several associated organs are lost, including the osphradium and ctenidia; the latter is associated with the loss of auricles from the scaphopod heart. There is also little record of ontogeny in the adult shell, as the older portion is periodically decollated to maintain the posterior aperture for passage of inhalant and exhalant currents. This and other constraints on scaphopod diversification are reflected in the range limits of shell shape within the class. In contrast, the "Dentalium" egg has been a model system for experimental embryology, particularly in studies of cell lineage and early morphogenesis. Later larval development and most organogenesis is nonetheless poorly known, although recent studies have considerably enhanced our knowledge in this area. Global biogeographic patterns of scaphopod diversity have been studied only preliminarily. A general decrease in diversity with depth is broken by small diversity peaks at bathyal depths. There is also evidence for a marked latitudinal diversity gradient in the world's oceans, near equatorial in the Pacific but at approximately 20 degrees N in the Atlantic. Scaphopods have a wide diversity of ecto- and endo-symbiotic associations with other organisms, including commensal bacteria and ciliates, mutualistic anemones and corals, and parasitic algae and platyhelminths. Other documented associations include predation by naticid gastropods and ratfish, and the inhabitation of empty scaphopod shells by a variety of sipunculans and hermit crabs. Phylogeny within the class is still unresolved, although significant progress has been made recently in documenting morphological variation among families, genera, and species for application in a cladistic context. The evolutionary relationships of Scaphopoda within Mollusca are farther from resolution, with every conchiferan class a proposed sister group among modern analyses. Molecular avenues should provide significant progress in scaphopod phylogenetics, as indicated by recent comparative sequence analysis and gene expression patterns. Scaphopods comprise the most recent class of mollusks to appear in the fossil record, dating at least from the Mississippian Carboniferous (362.5 My). They appear from first-order occurrence data to have a substantially documented fossil record, with several sharp extinction and radiation events evident during their comparatively short geologic history. The unresolved position of the Scaphopoda within molluscan phylogeny, and their relatively limited range of morphological disparity but substantial derivation from other conchiferans, renders the scaphopods an enigmatic group. They represent a significant evolutionary avenue within the Mollusca, but one that is poorly examined. Nonetheless, comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and documentation of diversity within this small, monophyletic, class-level taxon, well-preserved in the fossil record, is imminently tractable, and presents a singular opportunity in the study of molluscan evolution.

AB  - The second gnathopods of caprellid male amphipods are larger than the ones observed in females. The second gnathopods are armed with a propodus or tooth that is associated with a poison producing gland, by which male-male contests lead to fatal outcomes. Here we observed the ultrastructure of the second gnathopods by scanning electron microscopy and compared the relationship between the number of pores in the poison tooth and body length among the males of four caprellid species: Caprella acanthogaster, C. bispinosa, C. scaura, and C. penantis. All species possess pores on the poison tooth, and the number of pores increased with body size. The number of pores also differed among specimens of the four species. Furthermore, in males of three caprellid species, except for C. penantis, we found additional pores at the tip of the dactylus of second gnathopods. The number of pores on the tip of the dactylus did not increase with body length, and the average number of them differed among the three species. Although it is not known if venom is released from the pores of both structures, larger individuals that possess more pores on the second gnathopods could have a competitive advantage in male-male competition. © 2012 The Crustacean Society.

AB  - The amphipod Quadrivisio aviceps (KH Barnard 1940), previously known from just three records collected at two small estuaries in the Western Cape, South Africa, was re-discovered at one of the original collection sites (the Palmiet River lagoon). The population at the second site (the Klein River estuary) appears to have died out, and surveys of other nearby estuaries failed to detect any additional populations. The species thus now appears to be restricted to a few hundred metres within a single small estuary, making it perhaps South Africa's most range-restricted marine crustacean. The gnathopod 2 of males has an extremely unusual shortened and elbowed dactyl, as well as a newly discovered and unique horseshoe-shaped ‘spring’ of elastic resilin tissue inserted within the muscles of the propodus. The function of the structure could not be confirmed, but it is thought to be a previously unknown vibration or sound-generating mechanism.

AB  - In the mate-guarding amphipod, Gammarus pulex, the enlarged male posterior gnathopods have been variously suggested to function to grasp and subdue the female, to be used as weapons in fights between males, to signal to the female the male presence and stimulate moult accelaration, egg development or egg extrusion. These hy- potheses were tested in a series of experiments, the re- sults of which reveal an unexpected function. Ablation of the posterior gnathopods of males showed that they were neither necessary for, nor advantageous in, establishment and/or maintenance of precopula mate guarding, with or without competition with intact males. Furthermore, these appendages do not function to advance female moult, or stimulate egg development or extrusion. However, only males with intact posterior gnathopods were able to copu- late.We also show that females require a full copulation of several bouts to extrude eggs. We conclude that the func- tion of the posterior gnathopods is to facilitate copulation and suggest future studies focus on the selective pressures acting on copulating males.

AB  - © 2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd. Although sexually dimorphic traits are often well studied, we know little about sex-specific resource use strategies that should underlie such dimorphism. We measured sex-specific responses in acquisition and assimilation of two fundamental resources, carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) in juvenile and mature Hyalella amphipods given low and high supplies of inorganic phosphate, analogous to oligotrophic and eutrophic conditions, respectively. Additionally, we quantified allocation of resources to sexual traits in males. Dual radiotracer ( 14 C and 33 P) assays revealed substantial age- and sex-specific differences in acquisition and assimilation. Furt hermore, a phenotypic manipulation experiment revealed that amphipods fed low-P food allocated more C to all traits than those fed high-P food. Importantly, we found that amphipods preferentially allocated more C to the development of a sexually selected trait (the posterior gnathopod), compared with a serially homologous trait (the fifth pereopod) not under sexual selection. Substantial differences in how the sexes use fundamental resources, and the impact of altered nutrient supply on such differences, illuminate sexual dimorphism at the lowest level of biological organization. Such information will be important in understanding how sex- and age-specific life history demands influence nutrient processing in a biosphere characterized by rapidly changing alterations to biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - We report Phrixocephalus cincinnatus, a pennellid copepod infecting the eyes of flatfishes, from a single specimen of rex sole, Glyptocephalus zachirus, for the first time. In the typical host, the arrowtooth flounder, Atherestes stomias, the parasite occurred commonly in sampled populations from the Broughton Archipelago in British Columbia, infected primarily the right eye of the flounder, and on only one occasion presented more than two parasites per eye. The copepod attached to the choroid layer and ramified throughout the posterior compartment of the eye, resulting in the disruption of the retina and probably impairing host vision. Inflammation and hyperplasia progressed to necrosis and proliferation of connective tissue, resulting in the total destruction of the eye.

AB  - An animal with a parasite is not likely to behave like a similar animal without that parasite. This is a simple enough concept, one that is now widely recognized as true, but if we move beyond that statement, the light that it casts on behavior fades quickly: the world of parasites, hosts and behavior is shadowy, and boundaries are ill-defined. For instance, at first glance, the growing list of altered behaviors tells us very little about how those alterations happen, much less how they evolved. Some cases of parasite-induced behavioral change are truly manipulative, with the parasite standing to benefit from the changed behavior. In other cases, the altered behavior has an almost curative, if not prophylactic, effect; in those cases, the host benefits. This paper will provide an overview of the conflicting (and coinciding) demands on parasite and host, using examples from a wide range of taxa and posing questions for the future. In particular, what does the larger world of animal behavior tell us about how to go about seeking insights - or at least, what not to do? By asking questions about the sensory-perceptual world of hosts, we can identify those associations that hold the greatest promise for neuroethological studies of parasite-induced behavioral alterations, and those studies can, in turn, help guide our understanding of how parasite-induced alterations evolved, and how they are maintained.

AB  - The predation of haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus and whiting Merlangius merlangus on sandeel Ammodytes marinus was investigated based on intensive sampling [performed with a bottom trawl (GOV) equipped with a small meshed codend cover; sediment samples were taken with a van Veen grab] in a restricted area of c. 15 × 20 nautical miles in the northern North Sea during a 5 day period in July 1996. The analysis of the spatial distribution of predators revealed a pronounced aggregation of whiting in the south-west part of the area, where sandeel catches were also highest. This pattern was thought to be the result of an aggregative behaviour of whiting. The sandeel concentration most likely reflected a restricted patch of coarse sediment of the preferred grain size for sandeels to bury in. In haddock the aggregation was less obvious. Both predators fed almost exclusively on sandeel in the south-west part of the area with haddock stomachs containing more sandeel than whiting stomachs. The stomach contents in both predators increased rapidly during the night, indicating that the predators were targeting burying sandeels. This would explain the competitive advantage of the benthivorous haddock.

AB  - The parasite-stress model of human sociality proposes that humans' ontogenetic experiences with infectious diseases as well as their evolutionary historical interactions with these diseases exert causal influences on human psychology and social behavior. This model has been supported by cross-national relationships between parasite prevalence and human personality traits, and between parasite prevalence and societal values. Importantly, the parasite-stress model emphasizes the causal role of non-zoonotic parasites (which have the capacity for human-to-human transmission), rather than zoonotic parasites (which do not), but previous studies failed to distinguish between these conceptually distinct cate-gories. The present investigation directly tested the differential predictive effects of zoonotic and non-zoonotic (both human-specific and multihost) parasite prevalence on personality traits and societal values. Supporting the parasite-stress model, cross-national differences in personality traits (unrestricted sexuality, extraversion, openness to experiences) and in societal values (individualism, collectivism, gender equality, democratization) are predicted specifically by non-zoonotic parasite prevalence.

AB  - Three species of anisakine nematodes (Pseudoterranova decipiens, Contracaecum osculatum, Anisakis simplex) co-occur in the stomachs of Sable Island harbour seals (Phoca vitulina). The sealworm, P. decipiens, was the commonest nematode in these seals. Anisakis simplex was found in much smaller numbers, none mature, indicating that the harbour seal is not a true final host to this parasite. Contracaecum osculatum was rare but half were mature. Pseudoterranova decipiens increased in abundance with size of the seal. An inverse relationship was observed between P. decipiens abundance and the age of seals of similar size, probably owing to changes in diet. Numbers of P. decipiens may have declined over the summer, coincident with an increase in the proportion of mature worms in the stomach. From similarities between the worm infections of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) and harbour seals, we infer that A. simplex abundance may also exhibit a decline in abundance. Contracaecum osculatum was only encountered during the latter half of the year, suggesting an association with prey species of corresponding periodicity in their distribution. We estimate that the abundance of sealworm in harbour seals is about 2.5% of that carried by the grey seal population. This could imply that harbour seals represent an insignificant vector of the sealworm infecting commercial fish species in the Northwest Atlantic, provided density-dependent relationships exist between worm abundances in different host species.

AB  - The life cycle, medical importance and geographic distribution of sealworm (P. decipiens) are reviewed and methods for controlling the parasite are discussed. Current records of the abundance of sealworm and related anisakine nematode (Anisakis sp. and Contracaecum sp.) in cod (Gadus morhua), American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), and gray sole (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) from the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (41) and Breton Shelf (4Vn) Canada. Sealworm occurred mainly in the fillets, although they were also found in the flaps (hypaxial musculature of the abdomen) and in the body cavity of the fish host. The parasite was most numerous in inshore cod but was uniformly abundant in offshore cod from 4T and from 4Vn summer and winter fisheries. While worm abundances in 4T cod were similar to those recorded 25 yr ago, infections in 4Vn cod, plaice and gray sole were far heavier than previously reported. Anisakis sp. and Contracaecum sp. larvae were encysted on visceral organs and mesenteries but occurred infrequently in the flesh. These latter nematode species were most abundant in cod and plaice in the southern Gulf. Contracaecum sp. larvae were found infrequently in local 4Vn cod and were not detected in 4Vn plaice or sole. Because of the disparity in abundance of Contracaecum larvae in 4T and 4Vn cod, this parasite is an ideal tag for migrant 4T stocks. Prevalence and abundance of larval anisakines invariably increased with length of fish host. Analysis of variance revealed that variations in abundance with host length and geographic origin were highly significant, but abundance did not vary significantly with host sex. When fish were stored in the round on ice, adult and immature specimens of a 4th ascaridoid nematode, Hysterothylacium aduncum, migrated from the gastrointestinal tract of the fish and were found in the body cavity and flesh or leaving the host via the gills and mouth. There was no evidence that larval Anisakis migrate from the viscera to the flesh of iced round cod.

AB  - © 2018 John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd/CNRS. Ecological theory suggests that co-infecting parasite species can interact within hosts directly, via host immunity and/or via resource competition. In mice, competition for red blood cells (RBCs) between malaria and bloodsucking helminths can regulate malaria population dynamics, but the importance of RBC competition in human hosts was unknown. We analysed infection density (i.e. the concentration of parasites in infected hosts), from a 2-year deworming study of over 4000 human subjects. After accounting for resource-use differences among parasites, we find evidence of resource competition, priority effects and a competitive hierarchy within co-infected individuals. For example reducing competition via deworming increased Plasmodium vivax densities 2.8-fold, and this effect is limited to bloodsucking hookworms. Our ecological, resource-based perspective sheds new light into decades of conflicting outcomes of malaria-helminth co-infection studies with significant health and transmission consequences. Beyond blood, investigating within-human resource competition may bring new insights for improving human health.

AB  - The effects of melatonin, amlodipine, diltiazem (L-type Ca 2+ channel blockers) and ω-conotoxin (N-type Ca 2+ channel blocker) on the glutamate-dependent excitatory response of striatal neurones to sensory-motor cortex stimulation was studied in a total of 111 neurones. Iontophoresis of melatonin produced a significant attenuation of the excitatory response in 85.2% of the neurones with a latency period of 2 min. Iontophoresis of either L- or N-type Ca 2+ channel blocker also produced a significant attenuation of the excitatory response in more than 50% of the recorded neurones without significant latency. The simultaneous iontophoresis of melatonin + amlodipine or melatonin + diltiazem did not increase the attenuation produced by melatonin alone. However, the attenuation of the excitatory response was significantly higher after ejecting melatonin + ω-conotoxin than after ejecting melatonin alone. The melatonin-Ca 2+ relationship was further supported by iontophoresis of the Ca 2+ ionophore A-23187, which suppressed the inhibitory effect of either melatonin or Ca 2+ antagonists. In addition, in synaptosomes prepared from rat striatum, melatonin produced a decrease in the Ca 2+ influx measured by Fura-2AM fluorescence. Binding experiments with [ 3 H]MK-801 in membrane preparations from rat striatum showed that melatonin did not compete with the MK-801 binding sites themselves although, in the presence of Mg 2+ , melatonin increased the affinity of MK-801. The results suggest that decreased Ca 2+ influx is involved in the inhibitory effects of melatonin on the glutamatergic activity of rat striatum.

AB  - The coastal regions of the northeast Pacific support large, economically valuable fishery resources and provide nursery areas for many fish species. Over the last few decades, there have been dramatic shifts in species abundance and composition in this area. In this paper, we examine the springtime spatial patterns in the ichthyoplankton of three oceanographically different regions, the Southeast Bering Sea, the Gulf of Alaska and the U.S. West Coast. The data examined are a subset of a larger database (comprising data from cruises conducted from 1972 to 1997) that is being used to investigate spatial, seasonal and interannual patterns in ichthyoplankton of the northeast Pacific in relation to environmental conditions. Ichthyoplankton were collected during seven cruises using 60-cm bongo nets. Spatial patterns of ichthyoplankton were examined using both classification and ordination techniques. Relative Bray-Curtis dissimilarity coefficients calculated from the log10 (n+1) of abundance data were used as input to the numerical classification of species and stations. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was also applied to the abundance data to examine geometric patterns in the data. The numerical analyses of the species abundance data sets for each cruise revealed spatial patterns in the ichthyoplankton that suggest the occurrence of geographically distinct assemblages of fish larvae in each region. For all three sampling regions, the assemblage structure is primarily related to bathymetry, and Shelf, Slope, and Deep-Water assemblages are described. This shallow to deep-water gradient in species occurrence and abundance reflects the habitat preference and spawning location of the adult fish. Another degree of complexity is superimposed on this primary assemblage structure in each region and seems to be related to local topography and the prevailing current patterns. The patterns in ichthyoplankton assemblages of the three regions in the northeast Pacific Ocean described here form the basis for future investigations of spatial and temporal patterns in the ichthyoplankton of the subarctic Pacific.

AB  - The population differentiation of seven flatfish species, Citharus linguatula, Lepidorhombus boscii, Platichthys flesus, Microchirus azevia, Solea lascaris, Solea senegalensis and Solea solea, widely distributed along the eastern north Atlantic and occurring in sympatry along the Portuguese coast was studied using morphological and parasitological data. Fish were obtained from commercial fishing vessels operating in three locations along the Portuguese coast (north, centre and south) between January 2003 and June 2005. Eleven morphometric and seven meristic characters were considered in morphological analyses. Size effect was removed from morphometric measurements by principal component analysis and a multivariate discriminant analysis was performed to investigate the differences between populations using both morphometric and meristic data, separately. Individuals were examined for macroparasites infections according to standard procedures, and a multivariate discriminant analysis was also applied to investigate population differences. Analyses of both types of data (morphological and parasitological) revealed a similar pattern of a generally low differentiation evidenced by the high overlap of individuals in the ordination diagrams. However, some differentiation was found between samples from the west (north and centre) and the south Portuguese coast evidencing the existence of an ecological differentiation along the Portuguese coast. Broad scale population studies should, therefore, take into account the information provided by such data, especially with regard to fisheries' management policies and stock definition. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fishing is one of the most important employers and sources of protein for coastal communities in Belize. Yet bottom trawls and other kinds of unselective fishing gear cause harm to other fisheries and to the marine environment by catching juvenile fish, damaging the seafloor, and leading to overfishing. Bottom trawl nets can also harm coral reefs, sharks, and sea turtles that attract valuable tourism to Belize. The majority of international tourists come to Belize in order to participate in an ocean-related activity such as snorkeling, diving, or sport fishing charters, bringing hundreds of millions of Belize dollars each year to the economy. Destructive fishing gears ruin future development opportunities for Belize by undermining both fisheries and tourism, which depend on a healthy marine environment.

AB  - The extent to which host biology, ecology and phylogeny determine the diversity of macroparasite assemblages has been investigated in recent years in several taxa, including fish. However, consensus has not been reached probably as a result of data being collected from different sources, different temporal scales or host and parasite biogeography and phylogeny having greater influence than expected. The present study evaluates the relative importance of 27 biological, ecological and phylogenetic characteristics of 14 flatfish species on the diversity of their ecto- and endoparasite assemblages, comprising a total of 53 taxa. Redundancy analyses were applied to the mean abundance of each parasite taxa infecting each host and to the richness, taxonomic distinctness and variance in taxonomic distinctness calculated for each assemblage within each host. Only a few host characteristics contributed significantly to the observed patterns: host distribution was more important in determining the type and mean abundance of ectoparasites present in an assemblage, whereas diversity of these assemblages were mainly related to the host's maximum size. Endoparasite mean abundance and diversity were mostly influenced by the number of food items ingested and by the presence of Crustacea and Polychaeta in the diet. However, the sympatric occurrence of related hosts also played an important role in the diversity values found in macroparasite assemblages. Results showed that a host characteristic has different importance according to the host-parasite relationship being examined, suggesting an important role for host-parasite co-evolution on the diversity of extant macroparasite assemblages.

AB  - Eighteen species of helminths were analysed in relation to host-parasite specificity and the effect of host ecological preferences on the establishment of the parasite fauna in the alimentary tract of four pleuronectid flatfish, flounder Pleuronectes flesus, witch flounder Glyptocephalus cynoglossus, American plaice Hippoglossoides platessoides, and Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus in northern Norway. Thirteen species were generalists and the diversity of the parasite faunas decreased with increasing depths inhabited by the host. Similarities were greatest between the parasite faunas of flounder and American plaice and least between flounder and witch flounder. Host ecology, rather than phylogenetic relationships of these hosts, mainly influences the composition and diversity of the parasite communities of flatfishes in northern Norway.

AB  - Two methods, digestion and elution, were used to recover parasitic nematodes from 470 flatfish belonging to species in the family Pleuronectidae. Samples of similar fish were collected from market lots; half of each sample was subjected to digestion, and half was subjected to elution (sedimentation). The edible (flesh) and the inedible (viscera) portions of each fish were analyzed separately. The total number of nematodes recovered by digestion was 1,110, which was not significantly greater than the 922 nematodes recovered by elution. However, digestion recovered 1,062 nematodes of the anisakine genera Anisakis and Phocanema, which are potentially pathogenic for human consumers of raw of semiraw fish. This number is significantly greater than the 608 pathogenic nematodes recovered by elution. Digestion also recovered 242 more nematodes from the edible flesh than did elution. Conversely, more nonpathogenic nematodes were recovered by elution. Approximately half the fish (240) had been collected in Boston markets, and the other half (230) had been collected in San Francisco markets. Fish from San Francisco each contained an average of eight nematodes, and those from Boston contained an average of less than one nematode per fish.

The most abundant trypanorhynchs were Dollfusiella that were found inseven different elasmobranch species. Pastinachus cf. sephen (Forsskål) was most species rich, with at least eight different trypanorhynch species. Highest prevalence (100%) was recorded for Pseudochristianella southwelli with a maximum intensity of 24 in Rhinobatos cf. punctifer Compagno & Randall (n=5). Within the elasmobranchs, highest prevalence (83.3%) was seen for Otobothrium carcharidis with a maximum intensity of 39 in Rhizoprionodon acutus (Rüppell). Host specificity values were recalculated for Kotorella pronosoma, Pseudogrillotia perelica, Callitetrarhynchus gracilis and Proemotobothrium southwelli.

AB  - We found evidence that a nematode (Skrjabinoclava morrisoni) adaptively\nmanipulates the behavior of its intermediate host (the amphipod Corophium\nvolutator) to increase its likelihood of transmission to its final\nhost (the semipalmated sandpiper, Calidris pusilla). We found that\nmale and female amphipods parasitized by nematodes increased their\nsurface activity in the field during daytime, but not during nighttime\nhours. Increased surface activity is known to increase susceptibility\nof amphipods to predation by sandpipers during the day, but not at\nnight, when sandpipers do not feed visually. Also, as predicted by\nthe manipulation hypothesis, only late-stage (infective) larvae of\nnematodes were associated with behavioral changes of amphipods. We\nfound no evidence that parasites were associated with other amphipod\nbehaviors in the laboratory, such as trail complexity, distance traveled,\nor burrow-probing activity of crawling males as would be expected\nif parasitized hosts altered their own behavior. Survivorship of\namphipods was also unaffected by parasitism, which may favor parasite\ntransmission. Thus, behavioral changes of parasitized hosts were\nsimple, and their expression was context-dependent and related to\nlikelihood of predation. We argue that maturation times of nematodes\nin relation to migration schedules of sandpipers provide a narrow\nwindow of opportunity and may explain why nematodes manipulate amphipod\nbehavior

AB  - One of the most pervasive themes in ecology is that biological diversity stabilizes ecosystem processes and the services they provide to society, a concept that has become a common argument for biodiversity conservation. Species-rich communities are thought to produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because of the complementary or independent dynamics among species that perform similar ecosystem functions. Such variance dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio effect and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity on the stability of financial portfolios. In ecology, these arguments have focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered the importance of biologically relevant diversity within individual species. Current rates of population extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates, so there is a pressing need to clarify how population and life history diversity affect the performance of individual species in providing important ecosystem services. Here we use five decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of portfolio effects that derive from population and life history diversity in an important and heavily exploited species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population, such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of maintaining population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them. The reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster than indicated by species loss alone.

AB  - Traditional bioassays are still necessary to test sensitivity of sea lice species to chemotherapeutants, but the methodology applied by the different scientists has varied over time in respect to that proposed in "Sea lice resistance to chemotherapeutants: A handbook in resistance management" (2006). These divergences motivated the organization of a workshop during the Sea Lice 2016 conference "Standardization of traditional bioassay process by sharing best practices." There was an agreement by the attendants to update the handbook. The objective of this article is to provide a baseline analysis of the methodology for traditional bioassays and to identify procedures that need to be addressed to standardize the protocol. The methodology was divided into the following steps: bioassay design; material and equipment; sea lice collection, transportation and laboratory reception; preparation of dilution; parasite exposure; response evaluation; data analysis; and reporting. Information from the presentations of the workshop, and also from other studies, allowed for the identification of procedures inside a given step that need to be standardized as they were reported to be performed differently by the different working groups. Bioassay design and response evaluation were the targeted steps where more procedures need to be analysed and agreed upon.

AB  - Sea lice are copepod ectoparasites with vast reproductive potential and affect a wide variety of fish species. The number of parasites causing morbidity is proportional to fish size. Natural low host density restricts massive parasite dispersal. However, expanded salmon farming has shifted the conditions in favor of the parasite. Salmon farms are often situated near wild salmonid migrating routes, with smolts being particularly vulnerable to sea lice infestation. In order to protect both farmed and wild salmonids passing or residing in the proximity of the farms, several measures are taken. Medicinal treatment of farmed fish has been the most predictable and efficacious, leading to extensive use of the available compounds. This has resulted in drug-resistant parasites occurring on farmed and possibly wild salmonids.

AB  - © 2016, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.The advent and growth of salmon farming has changed the epidemiology of some salmon diseases. In 2015, in the salmon-farming region of the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia, an outbreak of native ectoparasitic copepods (sea lice; Lepeophtheirus salmonis) recurred in wild juvenile salmon after a decade of effective control. We draw on a 15-year data set of sea lice on wild and farmed salmon in the area to assess the evidence for four factors that may explain the recent outbreak: (i) poorly timed parasiticide treatments of farmed salmon relative to wild salmon migration, (ii) evolution of resistance to parasiticide treatments in sea lice, (iii) anomalous environmental conditions promoting louse population growth, and (iv) a high influx of lice with an abundant pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) return in 2014. We propose that a combination of poorly timed treatments and warm environmental conditions likely explains the outbreak. Where wild salmon conservation is a concern, a more effective approach to managing sea lice on wild and farmed salmon could incorporate the out-migration timing of wild juvenile salmon and information on environmental conditions.

AB  - Salmon lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, are naturally occurring parasites of salmon in sea water. Intensive salmon farming provides better conditions for parasite growth and transmission compared with natural conditions, creating problems for both the salmon farming industry and, under certain conditions, wild salmonids. Salmon lice originating from farms negatively impact wild stocks of salmonids, although the extent of the impact is a matter of debate. Estimates from Ireland and Norway indicate an odds ratio of 1.1:1-1.2:1 for sea lice treated Atlantic salmon smolt to survive sea migration compared to untreated smolts. This is considered to have a moderate population regulatory effect. The development of resistance against drugs most commonly used to treat salmon lice is a serious concern for both wild and farmed fish. Several large initiatives have been taken to encourage the development of new strategies, such as vaccines and novel drugs, for the treatment or removal of salmon lice from farmed fish. The newly sequenced salmon louse genome will be an important tool in this work. The use of cleaner fish has emerged as a robust method for controlling salmon lice, and aquaculture production of wrasse is important towards this aim. Salmon lice have large economic consequences for the salmon industry, both as direct costs for the prevention and treatment, but also indirectly through negative public opinion. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Gray whales foraging in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Canada exploit a variety of prey items. Hyperbenthic mysids are presently the main prey item of gray whales in Clayoquot Sound and have been under intense predation pressure by gray whales for several years. Little is known concerning their distributions and reproductive strategies on temporal and spatial scales finer than seasons and continents. A comparison of the species and life stage composition of the mysid community within Clayoquot Sound based on data collected from net samples showed non random distribution of these parameters. Between - year comparisons showed differences in mysid reproduction and whale predation. These results are discussed within the context of whale distributions in the study area and physical oceanographic determinants. Median mysid body length and the proportion of gravid females were greater in aggregations predated upon by gray whales however, while the difference in median mysid body length was statistically sigruficant at the 0.05 level, the difference in gravid females was not (p=0.068). As gravid females tend to be longest, this statistically insignificant result likely has biological consequences pertaining to recovery of heavily utilized mysid populations. The third part of this study centers on footage taken with an underwater video camera. Video footage enabled a qualitative assessment of mysid aggregations and allowed a true indication of mysid absence. Mysid habitat that had supported large populations of mysids in previous years was virtually empty during the 2000 season. Baleen whales have the capability to depress prey populations below a useful density. The results of this study suggest that baleen whales may also be capable of inhibiting recovery of prey populations and render previously used feeding habitat temporarily unusable. Interactions with other factors, such as unusual algal blooms, pose a potential route by which a lower stable state could be achieved, thus rendering habitat unusable for prolonged periods of time.

AB  - In 1999, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) undertook a risk assessment ofemamectin benzoate in the marine environment following its administration to marine cagefish for control of sea lice infestations. As part of this risk assessment, SEPA derivedEnvironmental Quality Standards (EQS) for the sea water and sediment. The EQS included a“far-field” sediment Maximum Acceptable Concentration (MAC) for the protection of all marinelife >25 m from the marine cages and a “near-field” MAC trigger value for additionalmonitoring applicable to sediment within 25 m of the marine cages. An EQS-MAC for thewater column was also derived. It has been 16 years since the data on emamectin benzoatehas been reviewed and the aim of this project was to review all of the current data todetermine if the EQSs derived in 1999 remained scientifically valid, and potentially derive newEQSs according to current regulatory guidance.

AB  - The World Wildlife Fund is facilitating a dialogue on impacts of salmon aquaculture. The goal of the dialogue is to establish the state of knowledge in seven subject areas associated with the industry: benthic impacts, nutrient loading, escapees, chemical inputs, diseases, feeds and social issues and to establish international standards for salmon aquaculture practices. Chemical inputs from salmon aquaculture include antifoulants, antibiotics, parasiticides, anaesthetics and disinfectants. The use and potential effects of these compounds are herein summarized for the four major salmon producing nations: Norway, Chile, UK and Canada. Regulations governing chemical use in each country are presented as are the quantities and types of compounds used. The problems associated with fish culture are similar in all jurisdictions, the magnitude of problems is not and the number of compounds available to the fish farmer varies from country to country. Unfortunately, the requirement to publically report chemical use is inconsistent among countries. Chemical use data are available from Norway, Scotland and parts of Canada. The government of Chile and some Canadian provinces, while requiring that farmers report disease occurrence, compounds prescribed and quantities used, do not make this information readily available to the public. The fact that these data are available from regulatory agencies in Scotland and Norway adds pressure for other jurisdictions to follow suit. Data such as these are essential to planning and conducting research in field situations.

AB  - A bioassay for sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis sensitivity towards emamectin benzoate (EMB) was validated for field use. A probit regression model with natural responsiveness was used for the number of affected (moribund or dead) sea lice in bioassays involving different concentrations of EMB. Bioassay optimization included an evaluation of the inter-rater reliability of sea lice responsiveness to EMB and an evaluation of gender-related differences in susceptibility. Adoption of a set of bioassay response criteria improved the concordance (evaluated using the concordance correlation coefficient) between raters' assessments and the model estimation of EC50 values (the 'effective concentration' leading to a response of 50% of the lice not prone to natural response). An evaluation of gender-related differences in EMB susceptibility indicated that preadult stage female sea lice exhibited a significantly larger sensitivity towards EMB in 12 of 19 bioassays compared to preadult males. In order to evaluate sea lice sensitivity to EMB in eastern Canada, the intensive salmon farming area in the Bay of Fundy in southwestern New Brunswick was divided into 4 distinct regions based on industry health management practices and hydrographics. A total of 38 bioassays were completed from 2002 to 2005 using populations of preadult stage sea lice collected from Atlantic salmon Salmo salar farms within the 4 described regions. There was no significant overall effect of region or year on EC50 values; however, analysis of variance indicated a significant effect of time of year on EC50 values in 2002 and a potential effect in 2004 to 2005. Although the range of EC50 values obtained in this 3 yr study did not appear sufficient to affect current clinical success in the control of sea lice, the results suggest a seasonal- or temperature-associated variation in sensitivity to EMB. This will need to be considered if changes in EMB efficacy occur in the future.

AB  - Forest inventory studies in the Amazon indicate a large terrestrial carbon sink. However, field plots may fail to represent forest mortality processes at landscape-scales of tropical forests. Here we characterize the frequency distribution of disturbance events in natural forests from 0.01 ha to 2,651 ha size throughout Amazonia using a novel combination of forest inventory, airborne lidar and satellite remote sensing data. We find that small-scale mortality events are responsible for aboveground biomass losses of ~1.7 Pg C y(-1) over the entire Amazon region. We also find that intermediate-scale disturbances account for losses of ~0.2 Pg C y(-1), and that the largest-scale disturbances as a result of blow-downs only account for losses of ~0.004 Pg C y(-1). Simulation of growth and mortality indicates that even when all carbon losses from intermediate and large-scale disturbances are considered, these are outweighed by the net biomass accumulation by tree growth, supporting the inference of an Amazon carbon sink.

AB  - Biological transfer of nutrients and materials between linked ecosystems influences global carbon budgets and ecosystem structure and function. Identifying the organisms or functional groups that are responsible for nutrient transfer, and quantifying their influence on ecosystem structure and carbon capture is an essential step for informed management of ecosystems in physically distant, but ecologically linked areas. Here, we combine natural abundance stable isotope tracers and survey data to show that mid-water and bentho-pelagic-feeding demersal fishes play an important role in the ocean carbon cycle, bypassing the detrital particle flux and transferring carbon to deep long-term storage. Global peaks in biomass and diversity of fishes at mid-slope depths are explained by competitive release of the demersal fish predators of mid-water organisms, which in turn support benthic fish production. Over 50% of the biomass of the demersal fish community at depths between 500 and 1800 m is supported by biological rather than detrital nutrient flux processes, and we estimate that bentho-pelagic fishes from the UK-Irish continental slope capture and store a volume of carbon equivalent to over 1 million tonnes of CO 2 every year. © 2014 The Authors Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Ensuring that the wealth of resources contained in our oceans are managed and developed in a sustainable manner is a priority for the emerging ’blue economy’. However, modern ecosystem-based management approaches do not translate well to regions where we know almost nothing about the individual species found in the ecosystem. Here, we propose a new taxon-focused approach to deep-sea conservation that includes regulatory oversight to set targets for the delivery of taxonomic data. For example, a five-year plan to deliver taxonomic and genomic knowledge on a thousand species in regions of the ocean earmarked for industrial activity is an achievable target. High-throughput, integrative taxonomy can, therefore, provide the data that is needed to monitor various ecosystem services (such as the natural history, connectivity, value and function of species) and to help break the regulatory deadlock of high-seas conservation.

AB  - As coastal fisheries around the world have collapsed, industrial fishing has spread seaward and deeper in pursuit of the last economically attractive concentrations of fishable biomass. For a seafood-hungry world depending on the oceans' ecosystem services, it is crucial to know whether deep-sea fisheries can be sustainable. The deep sea is by far the largest but least productive part of the oceans, although in very limited places fish biomass can be very high. Most deep-sea fishes have life histories giving them far less population resilience/productivity than shallow-water fishes, and could be fished sustainably only at very low catch rates if population resilience were the sole consideration. But like old-growth trees and great whales, their biomass makes them tempting targets while their low productivity creates strong economic incentive to liquidate their populations rather than exploiting them sustainably (Clark's Law). Many deep-sea fisheries use bottom trawls, which often have high impacts on nontarget fishes (e.g., sharks) and invertebrates (e.g., corals), and can often proceed only because they receive massive government subsidies. The combination of very low target population productivity, nonselective fishing gear, economics that favor population liquidation and a very weak regulatory regime makes deep-sea fisheries unsustainable with very few exceptions. Rather, deep-sea fisheries more closely resemble mining operations that serially eliminate fishable populations and move on. Instead of mining fish from the least-suitable places on Earth, an ecologically and economically preferable strategy would be rebuilding and sustainably fishing resilient populations in the most suitable places, namely shallower and more productive marine ecosystems that are closer to markets. © 2011.

AB  - Deep-sea ecosystems represent the largest biome of the global biosphere, but knowledge of their biodiversity is still scant. The Mediterranean basin has been proposed as a hot spot of terrestrial and coastal marine biodiversity but has been supposed to be impoverished of deep-sea species richness. We summarized all available information on benthic biodiversity (Prokaryotes, Foraminifera, Meiofauna, Macrofauna, and Megafauna) in different deep-sea ecosystems of the Mediterranean Sea (200 to more than 4,000 m depth), including open slopes, deep basins, canyons, cold seeps, seamounts, deep-water corals and deep-hypersaline anoxic basins and analyzed overall longitudinal and bathymetric patterns. We show that in contrast to what was expected from the sharp decrease in organic carbon fluxes and reduced faunal abundance, the deep-sea biodiversity of both the eastern and the western basins of the Mediterranean Sea is similarly high. All of the biodiversity components, except Bacteria and Archaea, displayed a decreasing pattern with increasing water depth, but to a different extent for each component. Unlike patterns observed for faunal abundance, highest negative values of the slopes of the biodiversity patterns were observed for Meiofauna, followed by Macrofauna and Megafauna. Comparison of the biodiversity associated with open slopes, deep basins, canyons, and deep-water corals showed that the deep basins were the least diverse. Rarefaction curves allowed us to estimate the expected number of species for each benthic component in different bathymetric ranges. A large fraction of exclusive species was associated with each specific habitat or ecosystem. Thus, each deep-sea ecosystem contributes significantly to overall biodiversity. From theoretical extrapolations we estimate that the overall deep-sea Mediterranean biodiversity (excluding prokaryotes) reaches approximately 2805 species of which about 66% is still undiscovered. Among the biotic components investigated (Prokaryotes excluded), most of the unknown species are within the phylum Nematoda, followed by Foraminifera, but an important fraction of macrofaunal and megafaunal species also remains unknown. Data reported here provide new insights into the patterns of biodiversity in the deep-sea Mediterranean and new clues for future investigations aimed at identifying the factors controlling and threatening deep-sea biodiversity.

AB  - © Cambridge University Press, 2010. Introduction One of the principal aims of cosmology is to identify the correct cosmological model, able to explain the available high-quality data. Determining the best model is a two-stage process. First, we must identify the set of parameters that we will allow to vary in seeking to fit the observations. As part of this process we need also to fix the allowable (prior) ranges that these parameters might take, most generally by providing a probability density function in the N-dimensional parameter space. This combination of parameter set and prior distribution is what we will call a model, and it should make calculable predictions for the quantities we are going to measure. Having chosen the model, the second stage is to determine, from the observations, the ranges of values of the parameters which are compatible with the data. This second step, parameter estimation, is described in the cosmological context by Lewis and Bridle in Chapter 3 of this volume. In this article, we shall concentrate on the choice of model. Typically, there is not a single model that we wish to fit to the data. Rather, the aim of obtaining the data is to choose between competing models, where different physical processes may be responsible for the observed outcome. This is the statistical problem of model comparison, or model selection. This is readily carried out by extending the Bayesian parameter estimation framework so that we assign probabilities to models, as well as to parameter values within those models.

AB  - The deep sea is often viewed as a vast, dark, remote, and inhospitable environment, yet the deep ocean and seafloor are crucial to our lives through the services that they provide. Our understanding of how the deep sea functions remains limited, but when treated synoptically, a diversity of supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural services becomes apparent. The biological pump transports carbon from the atmosphere into deep-ocean water masses that are separated over prolonged periods, reducing the impact of anthropogenic carbon release. Microbial oxidation of methane keeps another potent greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere while trapping carbon in authigenic carbonates. Nutrient regeneration by all faunal size classes provides the elements necessary for fueling surface productivity and fisheries, and microbial processes detoxify a diversity of compounds. Each of these processes occur on a very small scale, yet considering the vast area over which they occur they become important for the global functioning of the ocean. The deep sea also provides a wealth of resources, including fish stocks, enormous bioprospecting potential, and elements and energy reserves that are currently being extracted and will be increasingly important in the near future. Society benefits from the intrigue and mystery, the strange life forms, and the great unknown that has acted as a muse for inspiration and imagination since near the beginning of civilization. While many functions occur on the scale of microns to meters and timescales up to years, the derived services that result are only useful after centuries of integrated activity. This vast dark habitat, which covers the majority of the globe, harbors processes that directly impact humans in a variety of ways; however, the same traits that differentiate it from terrestrial or shallow marine systems also result in a greater need for integrated spatial and temporal understanding as it experiences increased use by society. In this manuscript we aim to provide a foundation for informed conservation and management of the deep sea by summarizing the important role of the deep sea in society. © 2014 Author(s).

AB  - Very little work has been done to identify and characterise the goods and services of the sea, and even less for the deep sea. We present a first categorisation and synthesis of deep-sea ecosystem goods and services, and review the current state of human knowledge about these services, the possible methods of their valuation, and possible steps forward in its implementation. Our conclusions highlight the nature and extent of research that is needed to overcome the gaps in knowledge that have been identified, and which have so far prevented the valuation of most deep-sea ecosystem goods and services. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chemosynthetic symbioses between bacteria and marine invertebrates were discovered 30 years ago at hydrothermal vents on the Galapagos Rift. Remarkably, it took the discovery of these symbioses in the deep sea for scientists to realize that chemosynthetic symbioses occur worldwide in a wide range of habitats, including cold seeps, whale and wood falls, shallow-water coastal sediments and continental margins. The evolutionary success of these symbioses is evident from the wide range of animal groups that have established associations with chemosynthetic bacteria; at least seven animal phyla are known to host these symbionts. The diversity of the bacterial symbionts is equally high, and phylogenetic analyses have shown that these associations have evolved on multiple occasions by convergent evolution. This Review focuses on the diversity of chemosynthetic symbionts and their hosts, and examines the traits that have resulted in their evolutionary success.

AB  - Fossil evidence of the existence of life during the Archean Eon of Earth history (>2500 Ma) is summarized. Data are outlined for 48 Archean deposits reported to contain biogenic stromatolites and for 14 such units that contain a total of 40 morphotypes of described microfossils. Among the oldest of these putatively microfossiliferous units is a brecciated chert of the ∼3465 Ma Apex Basalt of Western Australia. The paleoenvironment, carbonaceous composition, mode of preservation, and morphology of the Apex microbe-like filaments, backed by new evidence of their cellular structure provided by two- and three-dimensional Raman imagery, support their biogenic interpretation. Such data, together with the presence of stromatolites, microfossils, and carbon isotopic evidence of biological activity in similarly aged deposits, indicate that the antiquity of life on Earth extends to at least ∼3500 Ma. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) is a large notothenioid fish that supports valuable fisheries throughout the Southern Ocean. D. eleginoides are found on the southern shelves and slopes of South America and around the sub-Antarctic islands of the Southern Ocean. Patagonian toothfish are a long-lived species (>50 years), which initially grow rapidly on the shallow shelf areas, before undertaking an ontogenetic migration into deeper water. Although they are active predators and scavengers, there is no evidence of large-scale geographic migrations, and studies using genetics, biochemistry, parasite fauna and tagging indicate a high degree of isolation between populations in the Indian Ocean, South Georgia and the Patagonian Shelf. Patagonian toothfish spawn in deep water (ca. 1000. m) during the austral winter, producing pelagic eggs and larvae. Larvae switch to a demersal habitat at around 100. mm (1-year-old) and inhabit relatively shallow water (<300 m) until 6-7 years of age, when they begin a gradual migration into deeper water. As juveniles in shallow water, toothfish are primarily piscivorous, consuming the most abundant suitably sized local prey. With increasing size and habitat depth, the diet diversifies and includes more scavenging. Toothfish have weakly mineralised skeletons and a high fat content in muscle, which helps neutral buoyancy, but limits swimming capacity. Toothfish generally swim with labriform motion, but are capable of more rapid sub-carangiform swimming when startled. Toothfish were first caught as a by-catch (as juveniles) in shallow trawl fisheries, but following the development of deep water longlining, fisheries rapidly developed throughout the Southern Ocean. The initial rapid expansion of the fishery, which led to a peak of over 40,000. tonnes in reported landings in 1995, was accompanied by problems of bird by-catch and overexploitation as a consequence of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU). These problems have now largely been addressed, but continued vigilance is required to ensure that the species is sustainably exploited and the ecosystem effects of the fisheries are minimised. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Conservation conflict is widespread, damaging, and has proved difficult to manage using conventional conservation approaches. Conflicts are often “wicked problems,” lacking clear solutions due to divergent values of stakeholders, and being embedded within wickedly complex environments. Drawing on the concept of wicked environmental problems could lead to management strategies better suited to tackling conflict. However, it is unclear whether managers are embracing ideas from the wicked problems concept. There is currently a lack of guidance for applying strategies to tackle particular wicked problems, such as conservation conflict. We explored the suitability of wicked problems-inspired management, using eight contemporary conflict case studies. Conservation conflict was managed predominantly using conventional approaches suited to tackling single objectives in simple environments, rather than balancing competing objectives in complex environments. To deal with different characteristics of wickedness, we recommend that managers develop strategies combining distributed decision-making, diverse opinions, pattern-based predictions, trade-off-based objectives, and reporting of failures. Recent advances in conservation conflict research have focused on improving interactions among stakeholders. We believe that such stakeholder-focused approaches would dovetail with the whole-system focus of a wicked problems framework, allowing conservationists to move toward a holistic strategy for managing conservation conflict.

AB  - The World Wildlife Fund is facilitating a dialogue on impacts of salmon aquaculture. The goal of the dialogue is to establish the state of knowledge in seven subject areas associated with the industry: benthic impacts, nutrient loading, escapees, chemical inputs, diseases, feeds and social issues and to establish international standards for salmon aquaculture practices. Chemical inputs from salmon aquaculture include antifoulants, antibiotics, parasiticides, anaesthetics and disinfectants. The use and potential effects of these compounds are herein summarized for the four major salmon producing nations: Norway, Chile, UK and Canada. Regulations governing chemical use in each country are presented as are the quantities and types of compounds used. The problems associated with fish culture are similar in all jurisdictions, the magnitude of problems is not and the number of compounds available to the fish farmer varies from country to country. Unfortunately, the requirement to publically report chemical use is inconsistent among countries. Chemical use data are available from Norway, Scotland and parts of Canada. The government of Chile and some Canadian provinces, while requiring that farmers report disease occurrence, compounds prescribed and quantities used, do not make this information readily available to the public. The fact that these data are available from regulatory agencies in Scotland and Norway adds pressure for other jurisdictions to follow suit. Data such as these are essential to planning and conducting research in field situations. © 2010.

AB  - Executive Summary Revised projections about how climate change will affect tuna fisheries in the Pacific Ocean basin have recently been completed by the Pacific Community's Oceanic Fisheries Programme and partners. The new modelling simulates the response of tropical tuna species, and the ecosystem that supports them, to projected changes in sea surface temperature, ocean currents, dissolved oxygen levels and other ocean variables under the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) "business as usual" emissions scenario in 2050 and 2100. The modelling indicates that significant changes in the distribution of skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna and South Pacific albacore are expected to occur by 2050. These changes include:  a strong eastward shift in the distribution of skipjack and yellowfin tuna, resulting in reduced abundance of both species in the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) west of 170E in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO);  a similar but weaker eastward shift in the distribution of bigeye tuna;  a possible increase in the biomass of South Pacific albacore in the EEZs of PICTs, although the predictions are uncertain due to poor information about likely future levels of dissolved oxygen in oceanic waters; and  an increased abundance of tuna in high seas areas, resulting in a larger proportion of the catch of each species being made in international waters. The projected changes in distribution of tuna have implications for management, and monitoring, control and surveillance, of tuna fisheries across the tropical Pacific Ocean, including the possible need for the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) to assume even greater responsibility for management of the region's tuna resources. The redistribution of tuna from EEZs to high seas areas also has implications for the economies of PICTs. Conservative, preliminary analyses indicate that government revenue derived from tuna fishing licence fees will decrease in eight of the ten PICTs that currently provide 95% of the tuna caught in the Pacific Island region. These eight PICTs are Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Solomon Islands, Tokelau and Tuvalu. Adaptations are needed to reduce the effects of projected redistribution of tuna catches on government revenue in these eight countries, and to capitalise on projected increased presence of tuna in the other two countries (Kiribati and Cook Islands). These adaptations should include negotiations to assist PICTs to maintain their rights to manage tuna stocks displaced from their waters by climate change. Investments are needed to gain a better understanding of the effects of climate change on tropical tuna species to guide these adaptions. These investments should identify the distribution, size and behaviour of each tuna stock, and support improved modelling of the response of each tuna stock to climate change. 2

AB  - Policy Brief n° 20, December 2017
“The outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty from multiple sources, and dealing with these uncertainties is an important feature of policymaking.” Janet L. Yellen, Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, speech “Inflation, Uncertainty, and Monetary Policy” given the 26 September 2017. 
There has been a strong focus in recent policy debates, on the various types of uncertainty in the global economy from economic policy uncertainty to financial volatility. This Policy Brief presents the key challenges raised by this phenomena: How to measure uncertainty? Through which channels does uncertainty impact the economy? What are the implications of uncertainty for policy makers? We show evidence from the literature that uncertainty has adverse effects on the economic activity and draw three lessons for policy-makers facing increasing uncertainties. First, macroeconomic policies have a direct role to play in stabilizing policy-related uncertainty. Second, financial uncertainty should be modulated through financial regulation. Third, the effectiveness of economic stabilization policies depends on the state of uncertainty and should be adapted accordingly.

AB  - Tuna are globally distributed species of major commercial importance and some tuna species are a major source of protein in many countries. Tuna are characterized by dynamic distribution patterns that respond to climate variability and long-term change. Here, we investigated the effect of environmental conditions on the worldwide distribution and relative abundance of six tuna species between 1958 and 2004 and estimated the expected end-of-the-century changes based on a high-greenhouse gas concentration scenario (RCP8.5). We created species distribution models using a long-term Japanese longline fishery dataset and two-step generalized additive models. Over the historical period, suitable habitats shifted poleward for 20 out of 22 tuna stocks, based on their gravity centre (GC) and/or one of their distribution limits. On average, tuna habitat distribution limits have shifted poleward 6.5 km per decade in the northern hemisphere and 5.5 km per decade in the southern hemisphere. Larger tuna distribution shifts and changes in abundance are expected in the future, especially by the end-of-the-century (2080–2099). Temperate tunas (albacore, Atlantic bluefin, and southern bluefin) and the tropical bigeye tuna are expected to decline in the tropics and shift poleward. In contrast, skipjack and yellowfin tunas are projected to become more abundant in tropical areas as well as in most coastal countries' exclusive economic zones (EEZ). These results provide global information on the potential effects of climate change in tuna populations and can assist countries seeking to minimize these effects via adaptive management.

AB  - The distributions of migratory species in the ocean span local, national and international jurisdictions. Across these ecologically interconnected regions, migratory marine species interact with anthropogenic stressors throughout their lives. Migratory connectivity, the geographical linking of individuals and populations throughout their migratory cycles, influences how spatial and temporal dynamics of stressors affect migratory animals and scale up to influence population abundance, distribution and species persistence. Population declines of many migratory marine species have led to calls for connectivity knowledge, especially insights from animal tracking studies, to be more systematically and synthetically incorporated into decision-making. Inclusion of migratory connectivity in the design of conservation and management measures is critical to ensure they are appropriate for the level of risk associated with various degrees of connectivity. Three mechanisms exist to incorporate migratory connectivity into international marine policy which guides conservation implementation: site-selection criteria, network design criteria and policy recommendations. Here, we review the concept of migratory connectivity and its use in inter- national policy, and describe the Migratory Connectivity in the Ocean system, a migratory connectivity evidence-base for the ocean. We propose that without such collaboration focused on migratory connectivity, efforts to effectively conserve these critical species across jurisdictions will have limited effect.

AB  - Emamectin benzoate (EMB; SLICEr{script}) has been the drug of choice for the control of sea lice in salmon aquaculture within the past decade due to its ease of administration as well as efficacy on all parasitic stages of sea lice. This over-reliance has led to increased tolerance to the drug and a consequent decline in its use. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are known to be involved in drug resistance. The present study investigated 1) the interaction of EMB with P-gp, 2) the effect of increasing EMB concentrations on P-gp mRNA expression in male and female sea lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farms in the Bay of Fundy, NB, as well as 3) changes in the mRNA expression of the transporter in archived adult female L. salmonis. Analysis of bioassay results indicated a 4 to 26 fold higher EMB EC 50 for samples collected in 2011 compared to a similar study carried out between 2002 and 2004 suggesting loss of EMB efficacy in the parasite. An assay for ATPase activity as well as a competitive inhibition test showed that EMB interacts with the transporter. Emamectin benzoate had a significant concentration-dependent effect on P-gp mRNA expression in the parasite. There was a temporal increase in levels of P-gp mRNA in sea lice samples collected from 2002 to 2011. Our results indicate that EMB is a substrate for P-gp and that the transporter could be involved in the loss of efficacy of the parasiticide in L. salmonis. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Sea surface temperatures of the northwest Atlantic have warmed dramatically over the last several decades, while benthic temperatures have increased at a slower pace. Here we analyze a subset of the CMIP5 global Earth system model ensemble using a statistical downscaling approach to determine potential future changes in benthic temperatures on the northwest Atlantic continental shelf and slope (<500 m). We put future changes in the context of possible impacts of ocean warming on the high-value, wild-caught American Lobster (Homarus americanus) fishery. Future bottom temperatures of the northwest Atlantic under a business-as-usual (RCP8.5) and a climate-policy (RCP4.5) scenario are projected to increase by 0–1.5°C and 1.2–2.4°C by 2050 and 0–1.9°C and 2.3–4.3°C by the end of the century for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. H. americanus experiences thermal stress at temperatures above 20°C, and projected increases in temperature is likely to result in changes in the distribution of optimal thermal egg hatching and settlement indicators. Inshore regions of southern New England, where H. americanus biomass and catch have been declining historically, will likely become inhospitable under either future scenario, while thermal egg hatching and settlement indicators will expand offshore and in the Gulf of Maine. These changes imply that members of the fishery based in southern New England may need to recapitalize to larger vessels to prepare for potential changes brought on by future climate warming. Results from the downscaling presented here can be useful in preparing for potential changes to other fisheries or in future climate vulnerability analyses.

AB  - Ocean warming can drive poleward shifts of commercially important species with potentially significant economic impacts. Nowhere are those impacts greater than in the Gulf of Maine where North America's most valuable marine species, the American lobster (Homarus americanus Milne Edwards), has thrived for decades. However, there are growing concerns that regional maritime economies will suffer as monitored shallow water young-of-year lobsters decline and landings shift to the northeast. We examine how the interplay of ocean warming, tidal mixing, and larval behavior results in a brighter side of climate change. Since the 1980s lobster stocks have increased fivefold. We suggest that this increase resulted from a complex interplay between lobster larvae settlement behavior, climate change, and local oceanographic conditions. Specifically, postlarval sounding behavior is confined to a thermal envelope above 12degreeC and below 20degreeC. Summer thermally stratified surface waters in southwestern regions have historically been well within the settlement thermal envelope. Although surface layers are warming fastest in this region, the steep depth-wise temperature gradient caused thermally suitable areas for larval settlement to expand only modestly. This contrasts with the northeast where strong tidal mixing prevents thermal stratification and recent ocean warming has made an expansive area of seabed more favorable for larval settlement. Recent declines in lobster settlement densities observed at shallow monitoring sites correlate with the expanded area of thermally suitable habitat associated with warmer summers. This leads us to hypothesize that the expanded area of suitable habitat may help explain strong lobster population increases in this region over the last decade and offset potential future declines. It also suggests that the fate of fisheries in a changing climate requires understanding local interaction between life stage-specific biological thresholds and finer scale oceanographic processes.

AB  - In this period of environmental change, understanding how resource users respond to such changes is critical for effective resource management and adaptation planning. Extensive work has focused on natural resource responses to environmental changes, but less has examined the response of resource users to such changes. We used an interdisciplinary approach to analyse changes in resource use among commercial trawl fishing communities in the northwest Atlantic, a region that has shown poleward shifts in harvested fish species. We found substantial community-level changes in fishing patterns since 1996: southern trawl fleets of larger vessels with low catch diversity fished up to 400 km further north, while trawl fleets of smaller vessels with low catch diversity shrank or disappeared from the data set over time. In contrast, trawl fleets (of both large and small vessels) with higher catch diversity neither changed fishing location dramatically or nor disappeared as often from the data set. This analysis suggests that catch diversity and high mobility may buffer fishing communities from effects of environmental change. Particularly in times of rapid and uncertain change, constructing diverse portfolios and allowing for fleet mobility may represent effective adaptation strategies.

AB  - Dynamic food webs and climate are changing lobster ecology and management. American lobsters (Homarus americanus) evolved in the North Atlantic under conditions of intense predation from large finfish such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Lobster's relatively extended brood period and large larval size result in high per capita pelagic phase survival, which, coupled with settlement habitat selection for predator refugia, contributes to the species' high lifetime reproductive success. However, the western North Atlantic is an extremely low diversity ecosystem prone to booms and busts. Extirpation of coastal predators released past constraints on lobster population growth such that lobster landings increased three- to five-fold since 1980 in Canada and the US. Climate change may stress lobsters in some regions and enhance stocks elsewhere, but it also facilitates warm-water species distribution shift northward. As lobster population densities and water temperatures increase, so do risks and consequences of disease. In the future we must expect the unexpected. "Equilibrium" conditions on which traditional fisheries management depends simply do not exist. This creates new challenges for managing this species regionally and into the future.

AB  - The benthic settlement success of American lobster (Homarus americanus) postlarvae is a key factor in population dynamics, with the temperature being a key factor. Given the spatial distribution of the species, its pelagic larvae probably encounter various thermal zones during development. Little information is available on the ability of lobster larvae to acclimate to temperature or if this ability varies among geographic areas. The main objectives of this study were to characterize (i) the settlement behavior of the postlarvae in relation to (a) temperature during larval development and (b) the geographic origin of the maternal parent and (ii) the behavioral response of postlarvae with different thermal histories in the presence/absence of a thermocline. Results did not support the hypothesis of thermal adaptation among local populations, as settlement behavior of postlarvae did not differ among females from different geographic regions. In contrast, larval survival and settlement behavior and postlarval energetic conditions varied with development temperature. Behavioral plasticity in the benthic settlement was observed in relation to temperature structure of the experimental water column. This study suggests that there may be links between development temperature and the natural variability in survival and settlement of American lobsters. Findings emphasize the need for an integrated approach in lobster recruitment studies with the inclusion of behavior in dispersion models.

AB  - The Maine lobster Homarus americanus fishery is considered one of the most successful fisheries in the world due in part to its unique comanagement system, the conservation ethic of the harvesters, and the ability of the industry to respond to crises and solve collective-action problems. However, recent threats raise the question whether the industry will be able to respond to future threats as successfully as it has to ones in the past or whether it is now less resilient and can no longer adequately respond to threats. Through ethnographic research and oral histories with fishermen, we examined the current level of social resilience in the lobster fishery. We concentrated on recent threats to the industry and the ways in which it has responded to them, focusing on three situations: a price drop beginning in 2008, a recovery in 2010–2011, and a second collapse of prices in 2012. In addition, we considered other environmental and regulatory concerns identified by fishermen. We found that the industry is not responding effectively to recent threats and identified factors that might explain the level of social resilience in the fishery.

AB  - The ability of resource-dependent communities to adapt to climate change depends in part on their perceptions and prioritization of specific climate-related threats. In the Maine lobster fishery, which is highly vulnerable to warming water associated with climate change, we found a strong majority (84%) of fishers viewed warming water as a threat, but rank its impacts lower than other drivers of change (e.g., pollution). Two-thirds believed they will be personally affected by warming waters, but only half had plans to adapt. Those with adaptation plans demonstrated fundamentally different views of human agency in this system, observing greater anthropogenic threats, but also a greater ability to control the fishery through their own actions on the water and fisheries management processes. Lack of adaptation planning was linked to the view that warming waters result from natural cycles, and the expectation that technological advancements will help buffer the industry from warming waters.

AB  - The American lobster (Homarus americanus) fishery is currently the most valuable fishery on the Atlantic coasts of both the USA and Canada based on ex-vessel value. Lobster conservation policies have traditionally focused on technical restrictions such as minimum size requirements, v-notching, and a prohibition on taking egg-bearing females to protect the resource, rather than direct controls on fishing effort or catch. However, in 2005 the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission adopted a plan for the southern New England lobster management area (Area 2) that establishes a structure for limiting the number of license holders and the number of traps each lobsterman can have in the water. In this article, a bio-economic modeling exercise is employed to examine the biological and economic impacts of reductions to the level of fishing effort in a fishery that is modeled to represent the full-time lobster fishing fleet in Area 2. Model results show that a reduction in fishing effort has the potential to: (i) improve the sustainability characteristics of the lobster resource and, in contrast to popular belief, (ii) actually stimulate economic growth in the coastal economy.

AB  - Despite a generally uniform federal support infrastructure, aquaculture development in individual states differs widely in the United States. Even among eastern coastal states with shared natural attributes, introduction of reared species and rates of development may differ noticeably. Aquaculture development reflects existing natural, human and physical capital resources and may be influenced by statutes, regulations and public support. One dimension of the existing and emerging industry support involves financial and development programs. This paper presents data on the structure and utilization of public financing programs and nonprofit economic development support by commercial marine and inland aquaculture enterprises in the United States and selected subdivisions. The research illustrates the scope and magnitude of public sector financial support in eight states; however, the costs and benefits of the public investment need to be carefully examined. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - During 2014–2016, severe marine heatwaves in the northeast Pacific triggered well-documented disturbances including mass mortalities, harmful algal blooms, and declines in subtidal kelp beds. However, less attention has been directed towards understanding how changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and alongshore currents during this period influenced the geographic distribution of coastal taxa. Here, we examine these effects in northern California, USA, with a focus on the region between Point Reyes and Point Arena. This region represents an important biogeographic transition zone that lies <150 km north of Monterey Bay, California, where numerous southern species have historically reached their northern (poleward) range limits. We report substantial changes in geographic distributions and/or abundances across a diverse suite of 67 southern species, including an unprecedented number of poleward range extensions (37) and striking increases in the recruitment of owl limpets (Lottia gigantea) and volcano barnacles (Tetraclita rubescens). These ecological responses likely arose through the combined effects of extreme SST, periods of anomalous poleward flow, and the unusually long duration of heatwave events. Prolonged marine heatwaves and enhanced poleward dispersal may play an important role in longer-term shifts in the composition of coastal communities in northern California and other biogeographic transition zones.

AB  - Along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia sea urchin disease outbreaks are statistically linked to North Atlantic hurricanes and warm sea temperatures. The amoebic pathogen Paramoeba invadens, which causes these disease outbreaks, is unable to withstand typical minimum sea temperatures along this coast, suggesting that it is reintroduced during periods of peak temperatures. Here, we examine hypotheses for mechanisms of introduction or persistence of P. invadens using data on sea urchin disease outbreaks from a 5-yr field experiment (2010-2014), in combination with high-temporal-resolution oceanographic and meteorologic data. Disease outbreaks were observed in 4 yr, with the onset of mass mortality (≥50% morbidity or mortality) ranging from mid August to mid October. Physical data suggest that P. invadens originates in warm offshore surface waters that are transported to the coast during strong storms. Disease outbreaks were associated with passing hurricanes in 2 yr (2010 and 2011). In 2012, a disease outbreak occurred in the absence of a storm and following a strong positive anomaly in winter sea temperature, suggesting survival of the pathogen from 2011. In 2014, a disease outbreak occurred in association with a strong storm (nor'easter) that was not a hurricane. Our findings indicate that changing environmental conditions of increasing minimum sea temperatures and increasing intensity of storms may be altering the dynamics of this disease. These inferences remain equivocal, however, indicating the need for high-resolution dynamical modeling of the physical environment and rapid identification of P. invadens in the environment using genetic tools.

AB  - Extreme climatic events have recently impacted marine ecosystems around the world, including foundation species such as corals and kelps. Here, we describe the rapid climate-driven catastrophic shift in 2014 from a previously robust kelp forest to unproductive large scale urchin barrens in northern California. Bull kelp canopy was reduced by >90% along more than 350 km of coastline. Twenty years of kelp ecosystem surveys reveal the timing and magnitude of events, including mass mortalities of sea stars (2013-), intense ocean warming (2014-2017), and sea urchin barrens (2015-). Multiple stressors led to the unprecedented and long-lasting decline of the kelp forest. Kelp deforestation triggered mass (80%) abalone mortality (2017) resulting in the closure in 2018 of the recreational abalone fishery worth an estimated $44 M and the collapse of the north coast commercial red sea urchin fishery (2015-) worth $3 M. Key questions remain such as the relative roles of ocean warming and sea star disease in the massive purple sea urchin population increase. Science and policy will need to partner to better understand drivers, build climate-resilient fisheries and kelp forest recovery strategies in order to restore essential kelp forest ecosystem services.

AB  - Multihost infectious disease outbreaks have endangered wildlife, causing extinction of frogs and endemic birds, and widespread declines of bats, corals, and abalone. Since 2013, a sea star wasting disease has affected >20 sea star species from Mexico to Alaska. The common, predatory sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), shown to be highly susceptible to sea star wasting disease, has been extirpated across most of its range. Diver surveys conducted in shallow nearshore waters (n = 10,956; 2006–2017) from California to Alaska and deep offshore (55 to 1280 m) trawl surveys from California to Washington (n = 8968; 2004–2016) reveal 80 to 100% declines across a ~3000-km range. Furthermore, timing of peak declines in nearshore waters coincided with anomalously warm sea surface temperatures. The rapid, widespread decline of this pivotal subtidal predator threatens its persistence and may have large ecosystem-level consequences.

AB  - Faced with global warming, rising sea levels, and the climate-related extremes they intensify, the question is no longer whether some communities will retreat-moving people and assets out of harm's way-but why, where, when, and how they will retreat. To the extent that retreat is already happening, it is typically ad hoc and focused on risk reduction in isolation from broader societal goals. It is also frequently inequitable and often ignores the communities left behind or those receiving people who retreat. Retreat has been seen largely as a last resort, a failure to adapt, or a one-time emergency action; thus, little research has focused on retreat, leaving practitioners with little guidance. Such a narrow conception of retreat has limited decision-makers' perception of the tools available and stilted innovation. We propose a reconceptualization of retreat as a suite of adaptation options that are both strategic and managed. Strategy integrates retreat into long-term development goals and identifies why retreat should occur and, in doing so, influences where and when. Management addresses how retreat is executed. By reconceptualizing retreat as a set of tools used to achieve societal goals, communities and nations gain additional adaptation options and a better chance of choosing the actions most likely to help their communities thrive. We argue for strategy that incorporates socioeconomic development and for management that is innovative, evidence-based, and context-specific. These are not radical alterations to adaptation practice-adaptation planning often starts with identifying the goals people have, and context-specific implementation has long been a central tenet of adaptation-but they have been under-applied to retreat. Retreat is hard to do and even harder to do well, for many reasons: short-term economic gains of coastal development ; subsidized insurance rates and disaster recovery costs; misaligned incentives between residents, local officials, and national governments; imperfect risk perceptions ; place attachment; and preference for the status quo (1-6). A reconceptualization could make strategic, managed retreat an efficient and equitable adaptation option.

AB  - The ocean is a critical source of nutrition for billions of people, with potential to yield further food, profits, and employment in the future ( 1 ). But fisheries face a serious new challenge as climate change drives the ocean to conditions not experienced historically. Local, national, regional, and international fisheries are substantially underprepared for geographic shifts in marine animals driven by climate change over the coming decades. Fish and other animals have already shifted into new territory at a rate averaging 70 km per decade ( 2 ), and these shifts are expected to continue or accelerate ( 3 ). We show here that many species will likely shift across national and other political boundaries in the coming decades, creating the potential for conflict over newly shared resources.

AB  - Human population density in the coastal zone and potential impacts of climate change underscore a growing conflict between coastal development and an encroaching shoreline. Rising sea-levels and increased storminess threaten to accelerate coastal erosion, while growing demand for coastal real estate encourages more spending to hold back the sea in spite of the shrinking federal budget for beach nourishment. As climatic drivers and federal policies for beach nourishment change, the evolution of coastline mitigation and property values is uncertain. We develop an empirically grounded, stochastic dynamic model coupling coastal property markets and shoreline evolution, including beach nourishment, and show that a large share of coastal property value reflects capitalized erosion control. The model is parameterized for coastal properties and physical forcing in North Carolina, U.S.A. and we conduct sensitivity analyses using property values spanning a wide range of sandy coastlines along the U.S. East Coast. The model shows that a sudden removal of federal nourishment subsidies, as has been proposed, could trigger a dramatic downward adjustment in coastal real estate, analogous to the bursting of a bubble. We find that the policy-induced inflation of property value grows with increased erosion from sea level rise or increased storminess, but the effect of background erosion is larger due to human behavioral feedbacks. Our results suggest that if nourishment is not a long-run strategy to manage eroding coastlines, a gradual removal is more likely to smooth the transition to more climate-resilient coastal communities.

AB  - <p>Retreat from some areas will become unavoidable under intensifying climate change. Existing deployments of managed retreat are at small scale compared to potential future needs, leaving open questions about where, when, and how retreat under climate change will occur. Here, we analyze more than 40,000 voluntary buyouts of flood-prone properties in the United States, in which homeowners sell properties to the government and the land is restored to open space. In contrast to model-based evaluation of potential future retreat, local governments in counties with higher population and income are more likely to administer buyouts. The bought-out properties themselves, however, are concentrated in areas of greater social vulnerability within these counties, pointing to the importance of assessing the equity of buyout implementation and outcomes. These patterns demonstrate the challenges associated with locally driven implementation of managed retreat and the potential benefits of experimentation with different approaches to retreat.</p>

AB  - Global mean sea level rise (GMSLR) stemming from the multiple effects of human-induced climate change has potentially dramatic effects for inland land use planning and habitability. Recent research suggests that GMSLR may endanger the low-elevation coastal zone sooner than expected, reshaping coastal geography, reducing habitable landmass, and seeding significant coastal out-migrations. Our research reviews the barriers to entry in the noncoastal hinterland. Using three organizing clusters (depletion zones, win-lose zones, and no-trespass zones), we identify principal inland impediments to relocation and provide preliminary estimates of their toll on inland resettlement space. We make the case for proactive adaptation strategies extending landward from on global coastlines and illustrate this position with land use planning responses in Florida and China.

AB  - Researchers have quantified the contributions of industrialized and developing nations’ historical emissions to global surface temperature rise. Recent findings that nearly two-thirds of total industrial CO2 and CH4 emissions can be traced to 90 major industrial carbon producers have drawn attention to their potential climate responsibilities. Here, we use a simple climate model to quantify the contribution of historical (1880–2010) and recent (1980–2010) emissions traced to these producers to the historical rise in global atmospheric CO2, surface temperature, and sea level. Emissions traced to these 90 carbon producers contributed ∼57% of the observed rise in atmospheric CO2, ∼42–50% of the rise in global mean surface temperature (GMST), and ∼26–32% of global sea level (GSL) rise over the historical period and ∼43% (atmospheric CO2), ∼29–35% (GMST), and ∼11–14% (GSL) since 1980 (based on best-estimate parameters and accounting for uncertainty arising from the lack of data on aerosol forcings traced to producers). Emissions traced to seven investor-owned and seven majority state-owned carbon producers were consistently among the top 20 largest individual company contributors to each global impact across both time periods. This study lays the groundwork for tracing emissions sourced from industrial carbon producers to specific climate impacts and furthers scientific and policy consideration of their historical responsibilities for climate change.

AB  - This article presents governance and institutional strategies for climate-induced community relocations. In Alaska, repeated extreme weather events coupled with climate change-induced coastal erosion impact the habitability of entire communities. Community residents and government agencies concur that relocation is the only adaptation strategy that can protect lives and infrastructure. Community relocation stretches the financial and institutional capacity of existing governance institutions. Based on a comparative analysis of three Alaskan communities, Kivalina, Newtok, and Shishmaref, which have chosen to relocate, we examine the institutional constraints to relocation in the United States. We identify policy changes and components of a toolkit that can facilitate community-based adaptation when environmental events threaten people's lives and protection in place is not possible. Policy changes include amendment of the Stafford Act to include gradual geophysical processes, such as erosion, in the statutory definition of disaster and the creation of an adaptive governance framework to allow communities a continuum of responses from protection in place to community relocation. Key components of the toolkit are local leadership and integration of social and ecological well-being into adaptation planning.

AB  - During August 25-30, 2017, Hurricane Harvey stalled over Texas and caused extreme precipitation, particularly over Houston and the surrounding area on August 26-28. This resulted in extensive flooding with over 80 fatalities and large economic costs. It was an extremely rare event: the return period of the highest observed three-day precipitation amount, 1043.4 mm 3dy-1 at Baytown, is more than 9000 years (97.5% one-sided confidence interval) and return periods exceeded 1000 yr (750 mm 3dy-1) over a large area in the current climate. Observations since 1880 over the region show a clear positive trend in the intensity of extreme precipitation of between 12% and 22%, roughly two times the increase of the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere expected for 1 °C warming according to the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relation. This would indicate that the moisture flux was increased by both the moisture content and stronger winds or updrafts driven by the heat of condensation of the moisture. We also analysed extreme rainfall in the Houston area in three ensembles of 25 km resolution models. The first also shows 2 × CC scaling, the second 1 × CC scaling and the third did not have a realistic representation of extreme rainfall on the Gulf Coast. Extrapolating these results to the 2017 event, we conclude that global warming made the precipitation about 15% (8%-19%) more intense, or equivalently made such an event three (1.5-5) times more likely. This analysis makes clear that extreme rainfall events along the Gulf Coast are on the rise. And while fortifying Houston to fully withstand the impact of an event as extreme as Hurricane Harvey may not be economically feasible, it is critical that information regarding the increasing risk of extreme rainfall events in general should be part of the discussion about future improvements to Houston's flood protection system.

AB  - Marine life is being affected by changes in ocean conditions resulting from changes in climate and chemistry triggered by combustion of fossil fuels. Shifting spatial distributions of fish species is a major observed and predicted impact of these oceanographic changes, and such shifts may modify fish community structure considerably in particular locations and regions. We projected future range shifts of pelagic marine fishes of the Northeast Pacific shelf seas by 2050 relative to the present. We combined published data, expert knowledge, and pelagic fish survey data to predict current species distribution ranges of 28 fish species of the Northeast Pacific shelf seas that occur in the epipelagic zone and are well-represented in pelagic fish surveys. These represent a wide spectrum of sub-tropical to sub-polar species, with a wide range of life history characteristics. Using projected ocean condition changes from three different Earth System Models, we simulated changes in the spatial distribution of each species. We show that Northeast Pacific shelf seas may undergo considerable changes in the structure of its pelagic marine communities by mid-21st century. Ensembles of model projections suggest that the distribution centroids of the studied species are expected to shift poleward at an average rate of 30.1±2.34 (S.E.) km decade-1 under the SRES A2 scenario from 2000 to 2050. The projected species range shifts result in a high rate of range expansion of this group of species into the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. Rate of range contraction of these species is highest at the Aleutian Islands, and in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We also predict increasing dominance of warmer water species in all regions. The projected changes in species assemblages may have large ecological and socio-economic implications through mismatches of co-evolved species, unexpected trophic effects, and shifts of fishing grounds. These results provide hypotheses of climate change impacts that can be tested using data collected by monitoring programmes in the region.

AB  - C anada’s Pacifi c marine ecosystems, which lie adjacent to the coast of British Columbia, are rich, extraordinarily productive, and highly textured with conditions that vary considerably on diff erent scales of time and space. Th is marine and coastal environment is unique and of cultural, socio- economic, and ecological signifi cance to the people of British Columbia and the rest of Canada. Global environmental changes caused by greenhouse gas emissions are an increasing concern for the health of the whole region’s biologically rich ecosystems, and these must be examined in the context of the existing local and regional impacts, which are more manageable than global changes. Th e Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society and WWF-Canada commissioned the present report to synthesize current and projected impacts of these global changes, herein called “climate changes,” on Canada’s Pacifi c marine ecosystems. Th is report, and its companion report on adaptation approaches, was prepared to inform measures that can be employed to reduce the vulnerability of Canadian Pacifi c social-ecological systems to climate change, which can be considered in ocean and coastal resource planning. Th e synthesis in this report is based on two components: (1) a review of the literature relating to marine climate changes and impacts in British Columbia and the northeast Pacifi c Ocean, including projections from the Canadian Regional Climate Model and global climate models; and (2) a preliminary screening level vulnerability assessment, including components of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity

AB  - Ecosystem reconfigurations arising from climate-driven changes in species distributions are expected to have profound ecological, social, and economic implications. Here we reveal a rapid climate-driven regime shift of Australian temperate reef communities, which lost their defining kelp forests and became dominated by persistent seaweed turfs. After decades of ocean warming, extreme marine heat waves forced a 100-kilometer range contraction of extensive kelp forests and saw temperate species replaced by seaweeds, invertebrates, corals, and fishes characteristic of subtropical and tropical waters.This community-wide tropicalization fundamentally altered key ecological processes, suppressing the recovery of kelp forests.

AB  - Previous projection of climate change impacts on global food supply focuses solely on production from terrestrial biomes, ignoring the large contribution of animal protein from marine capture fisheries. Here, we project changes in global catch potential for 1066 species of exploited marine fish and invertebrates from 2005 to 2055 under climate change scenarios. We show that climate change may lead to large-scale redistribution of global catch potential, with an average of 30-70% increase in high-latitude regions and a drop of up to 40% in the tropics. Moreover, maximum catch potential declines considerably in the southward margins of semienclosed seas while it increases in poleward tips of continental shelf margins. Such changes are most apparent in the Pacific Ocean. Among the 20 most important fishing Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) regions in terms of their total landings, EEZ regions with the highest increase in catch potential by 2055 include Norway, Greenland, the United States (Alaska) and Russia (Asia). On the contrary, EEZ regions with the biggest loss in maximum catch potential include Indonesia, the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), Chile and China. Many highly impacted regions, particularly those in the tropics, are socioeconomically vulnerable to these changes. Thus, our results indicate the need to develop adaptation policy that could minimize climate change impacts through fisheries. The study also provides information that may be useful to evaluate fisheries management options under climate change. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Sea levels are rising, with the highest rates in the tropics, where thousands of low-lying coral atoll islands are located. Most studies on the resilience of these islands to sea-level rise have projected that they will experience minimal inundation impacts until at least the end of the 21st century. However, these have not taken into account the additional hazard of wave-driven overwash or its impact on freshwater availability. We project the impact of sea-level rise and wave-driven flooding on atoll infrastructure and freshwater availability under a variety of climate change scenarios. We show that, on the basis of current greenhouse gas emission rates, the nonlinear interactions between sea-level rise and wave dynamics over reefs will lead to the annual wave-driven overwash of most atoll islands by the mid-21st century. This annual flooding will result in the islands becoming uninhabitable because of frequent damage to infrastructure and the inability of their freshwater aquifers to recover between overwash events. This study provides critical information for understanding the timing and magnitude of climate change impacts on atoll islands that will result in significant, unavoidable geopolitical issues if it becomes necessary to abandon and relocate low-lying island states.

AB  - Coastal zones are exposed to a range of coastal hazards including sea-level rise with its related effects. At the same time, they are more densely populated than the hinterland and exhibit higher rates of population growth and urbanisation. As this trend is expected to continue into the future, we investigate how coastal populations will be affected by such impacts at global and regional scales by the years 2030 and 2060. Starting frombaseline population estimates for the year 2000, we assess future population change in the low-elevation coastal zone and trends in exposure to 100-year coastal floods based on four different sea-level and socio-economic scenarios. Our method accounts for differential growth of coastal areas against the land-locked hinterland and for trends of urbanisation and expansive urban growth, as currently observed, but does not explicitly consider possible displacement or out-migration due to factors such as sea-level rise.We combine spatially explicit estimates of the baseline population with demographic data in order to derive scenario-driven projections of coastal population development. Our scenarios show that the number of people living in the low-elevation coastal zone, as well as the number of people exposed to flooding from 1-in-100 year storm surge events, is highest in Asia. China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam are estimated to have the highest total coastal population exposure in the baseline year and this ranking is expected to remain largely unchanged in the future. However, Africa is expected to experience the highest rates of population growth and urbanisation in the coastal zone, particularly in Egypt and sub-Saharan countries in Western and Eastern Africa. The results highlight countries and regions with a high degree of exposure to coastal flooding and help identifying regions where policies and adaptive planning for building resilient coastal communities are not only desirable but essential. Furthermore, we identify needs for further research and scope for improvement in this kind of scenario-based exposure analysis.

AB  - Here, we describe an assessment of climate-change vulnerability for the salmon farming sector in southern Chile using a model that combines semi-quantitative measures of Exposure (risks), Sensitivity (economic and social dependence) and Adaptation Capacity (measures that prevent and mitigate impacts). The evaluation was carried out in eight pilot communes representative of salmon production (marine grow-out). Exposure was estimated with a semi-quantitative risk assessment tool based on oceanographic, meteorological and hydrological information, mortality-by-cause databases, and through extended consultation with experts and relevant stakeholders. Threats included relevant changes in water temperature and salinity, declines in dissolved oxygen, occurrence of HABs, and diseases that could be associated with climate change. Based on our analysis of the data, we divided the farming regions into four sub-regions with distinctive oceanographic properties and superimposed the sea surface warming trend and a spatial pattern of mortality by respective cause. Reduction of precipitation and the increase of air and sea surface temperature are the most relevant foreseen climate change drivers, especially for regions X and XI. The resulting vulnerability matrix indicated that communes with higher production concentrations were more exposed, which in some cases coincided with higher sensitivity and lower adaptation capacity. Our models of four management scenarios allowed us to explore the changes in vulnerability associated with a southward movement of salmon production towards the Magallanes region. By identifying new protocols to increase adaptation and reduce vulnerability in a spatially explicit fashion, we provide policy recommendations aimed at increasing climate change adaptation and the long-term sustainability of the sector.

AB  - The connection between our environment and parasitic diseases may not always be straightforward, but it exists nonetheless. This article highlights how climate as a component of our environment, or more specifically climate change, has the capability to drive parasitic disease incidence and prevalence worldwide. There are both direct and indirect implications of climate change on the scope and distribution of parasitic organisms and their associated vectors and host species. We aim to encompass a large body of literature to demonstrate how a changing climate will perpetuate, or perhaps exacerbate, public health issues and economic stagnation due to parasitic diseases. The diseases examined include those caused by ingested protozoa and soil helminths, malaria, lymphatic filariasis, Chagas disease, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, babesiosis, schistosomiasis, and echinococcus, as well as parasites affecting livestock. It is our goal to impress on the scientific community the magnitude a changing climate can have on public health in relation to parasitic disease burden. Once impending climate changes are now upon us, and as we see these events unfold, it is critical to create management plans that will protect the health and quality of life of the people living in the communities that will be significantly affected.

AB  - This paper connects critical legal geography and coastal climate change adaptation. It is particularly interested in the role that complex political ecologies and legal geographies have played in underpinning a decade of idealised integrated coastal management in New South Wales, Australia. In attending to the political-legal nature of coastal management through the lens of legal geography, this paper cogently illustrates the complexities of law's role as both a driver and a barrier to coastal climate change adaptation through a detailed review and analysis of repeated legislative reform between 2009 and 2018. This not yet documented or systemic analysis serves to highlight the politics of coastal climate change adaptation, and how private property ‘rights’ are used as both a sword and a shield to advance dominant interests. The paper offers specific examples of ways private property discourses have been used to muddy the waters of adaptation responses, and how private property discourses can pervade, dissuade, and undermine land use management policies even as such policies aim to achieve more harmonious coastal management.

AB  - Responding to global change represents an unprecedented challenge for society. Decision makers tend to address this challenge by framing adaptation as a decision problem, whereby the responses to impacts of change are addressed within existing decision processes centred on defining the decision problem and selecting options. However, this 'decision-making perspective' is constrained by societal values and principles, regulations and norms and the state of knowledge. It is therefore unsuitable for addressing complex, contested, cross-scale problems. In this paper we argue that simply broadening the decision-making perspective to account for institutions and values is not enough. We contend the decision-making perspective needs to be connected with a broader 'decision-context perspective' that focuses on how the societal system of decision processes affects the manner in which a particular problem is addressed. We describe the decision context as an interconnected system of values, rules and knowledge (vrk). The interaction of systems of vrk both creates and limits the set of practical, permissible decisions; the types of values, rules and knowledge that influence the decision and the capacity for change and transformation in the decision context. We developed a framework to analyse the interactions between values, rules and knowledge and their influence on decision making and decision contexts of adaptation initiatives, and applied it retrospectively to three projects on adaptation to sea-level rise. Our analysis revealed: (1) specific examples of how interactions between vrk systems constrained existing framings of decision making and the development of options for coastal adaptation; (2) limitations in the adaptive management strategies that underpinned the projects and (3) how the linked systems of vrk can allow adaptation practitioners to structure adaptation as a process of co-evolutionary change that enables a broader set of social issues and change processes to be considered. Adaptation projects that focus on the decision context represent a pragmatic alternative to existing decision-focused adaptation. By using the vrk model to diagnose constraints in decision processes, we show how the reframing of adaptation initiatives can reveal new approaches to developing adaptation responses to complex global change problems.

AB  - Coastal communities are crafting adaptation strategies to confront sea level rise (SLR). Unfortunately, cost–benefit analyses that assess SLR risks often fail to capture important political and social feedbacks. For example, adaptation measures (e.g., beach nourishment) can trigger greater development, undermining the value of adaptation infrastructure, incentivizing development, and increasing risks. We integrate diverse literature and data to develop a hypothesis and system dynamics model of coastal community responses to SLR. We apply the model to two U.S. communities, showing how political influence drives trajectories of infrastructure provision, cost, and vulnerability. We find that delayed feedbacks between perceived SLR risk and infrastructure investments mediate relationships between political capital, migration, and economic development. Community wealth and political influence may only delay the overshoot and collapse of its population and economy, as the “virtuous cycles” linking growth with infrastructure investment give way to “vicious cycles” of mounting infrastructure costs, political resistance to additional investment, and greater vulnerability.

AB  - BC's climate is changing, and scientists who study the climate are projecting further changes over the next decades. Preparing for these changes and the impacts they will have on natural systems and human communities is usually called "climate change adaptation", and is the subject of this guide. Understandably, much attention has been focused to date on "climate change mitigation", or efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere and help slow the rate of climate change. However, no matter how successful we are reducing GHG emissions that will be present in the atmosphere for many years to come. This means that both types of climate action are necessary: mitigation to avoid even more dangerous impacts, and adaptation to deal with the inevitable level of change that scientists advise we will continue to face for the next century or longer.

AB  - We used a first-of-its-kind comprehensive scenario approach to evaluate both the vertical and horizontal response of tidal wetlands to projected changes in the rate of sea-level rise (SLR) across 14 estuaries along the Pacific coast of the continental United States. Throughout the U.S. Pacific region, we found that tidal wetlands are highly vulnerable to end-of-century submergence, with resulting extensive loss of habitat. Using higher-range SLR scenarios, all high and middle marsh habitatswere lost, with 83%of current tidalwetlands transitioning to unvegetated habitats by 2110. The wetland area lost was greater in California and Oregon (100%) but still severe in Washington, with 68% submerged by the end of the century. The only wetland habitat remaining at the end of the century was low marsh under higherrange SLR rates. Tidal wetland loss was also likely under more conservative SLR scenarios, including loss of 95% of high marsh and 60%of middle marsh habitats by the end of the century. Horizontal migration of most wetlands was constrained by coastal development or steep topography, with just two wetland sites having sufficient upland space for migration and the possibility for nearly 1:1 replacement, making SLR threats particularly high in this region and generally undocumented.With low vertical accretion rates and little upland migration space, Pacific coast tidal wetlands are at imminent risk of submergence with projected rates of rapid SLR.

AB  - Elevated concentrations of CO 2 in seawater can disrupt numerous sensory systems in marine fish. This is of particular concern for Pacific salmon because they rely on olfaction during all aspects of their life including during their homing migrations from the ocean back to their natal streams. We investigated the effects of elevated seawater CO 2 on coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) olfactory-mediated behavior, neural signaling, and gene expression within the peripheral and central olfactory system. Ocean-phase coho salmon were exposed to three levels of CO 2 , ranging from those currently found in ambient marine water to projected future levels. Juvenile coho salmon exposed to elevated CO 2 levels for 2 weeks no longer avoided a skin extract odor that elicited avoidance responses in coho salmon maintained in ambient CO 2 seawater. Exposure to these elevated CO 2 levels did not alter odor signaling in the olfactory epithelium, but did induce significant changes in signaling within the olfactory bulb. RNA-Seq analysis of olfactory tissues revealed extensive disruption in expression of genes involved in neuronal signaling within the olfactory bulb of salmon exposed to elevated CO 2 , with lesser impacts on gene expression in the olfactory rosettes. The disruption in olfactory bulb gene pathways included genes associated with GABA signaling and maintenance of ion balance within bulbar neurons. Our results indicate that ocean-phase coho salmon exposed to elevated CO 2 can experience significant behavioral impairments likely driven by alteration in higher-order neural signal processing within the olfactory bulb. Our study demonstrates that anadromous fish such as salmon may share a sensitivity to rising CO 2 levels with obligate marine species suggesting a more wide-scale ecological impact of ocean acidification.

AB  - Anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are vulnerable to climate change in both freshwater and marine habitats. I use a qualitative model to assess the cumulative effects of climate change across life stages and generations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and other salmon species. The effects of climate change most relevant to Fraser River sockeye include warming of freshwater and marine habitats, altered hydrology in spawning rivers, reduced productivity in nursery habitats, and changed distribution and phenology of predator and prey species. The weight of evi- dence indicates that these changes will negatively affect growth and survival of Fraser River sockeye at all life stages. Ef- fects on one life stage will also carry forward to heighten adverse effects at subsequent life stages and across generations so that the cumulative impact is greater than the impact on individual stages. Salmon can adapt to climate change but probably not enough to sustain productivity. In the south, focus of policy and management on conserving and enhancing resilience is needed to retain some salmon production. At the same time, Arctic habitats are becoming accessible to salmon. Manage- ment in the Arctic should protect potentially productive habitats from development and facilitate their colonization by Pacific salmon.

AB  - Pacific salmon abundance along the West Coast of Canada has been in sharp decline since the early 1990s. Declines have been most severe for coho and chinook salmon despite large additions of hatchery-reared fry and smolts. There is particular concern for populations of wild coho because, in addition to low abundance, up to 80% of the juvenile coho in the coastal waters has been identified as being produced by enhancement projects. The most likely reasons for the decline in Pacific salmon stocks include a combination of climate change, overfishing, and freshwater habitat destruction. There have also been suggestions that salmon farming in British Columbia has contributed to the decline of salmon stocks. The hypothesized effects of salmon farming include potential ecological interactions as well as disease concerns. In this paper, we consider the effects of climate change on the abundance of wild salmon stocks as well as potential genetic, ecological, and disease concerns. Shifts in climate in 1977 and 1989 resulted in significant changes in production for a number of marine fish species including Pacific salmon. These climate-related changes, combined with local overfishing and the loss of freshwater habitat, have left some salmon stocks at very low levels. Large-scale salmon enhancement projects have also resulted in significant ecological and genetic interactions with wild salmon, particularly for coho and chinook stocks. These interactions have tended to reduce genetic diversity and result in the replacement of wild salmon by hatchery fish. Hatcheries also represent a potential source of disease pathogens although the magnitude of the problem is difficult to quantify because the disease agents of concern are widespread in both wild and hatchery Pacific salmon as well as a number of non-salmonid hosts. In addition, the same antibiotics used in the salmon farming industry are also used in salmon enhancement projects, making it difficult to identify the source of some pathogens. Although farmed salmon are also a potential source for these disease pathogens, surveys of pathogens in wild and hatchery fish show no patterns that could be attributed to salmon farming. Recent improvements in fish husbandry, including the development and widespread use of vaccines, have also reduced the risk of disease transfer from farmed fish to wild or hatchery fish. The combined evidence indicates that salmon farming, as currently practiced in British Columbia, poses a low risk to wild salmon stocks particularly when compared to other potential factors. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Parasites and pathogens can have an important effect on their host's thermal resistance. The impact of parasite infection on host physiological performances has traditionally been studied in controlled laboratory conditions, and much less is known about its actual effects in wild populations. Nonetheless, such knowledge is critical when assessing the effect of climate change on the future survival of the host. Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae is a myxozoan endoparasite causing proliferative kidney disease (PKD) in salmonids. Infection and clinical symptoms of PKD are dependent on environmental temperature and PKD has become an emerging disease of primary importance for farmed and wild salmonids in the last decades. Despite important achievements in understanding PKD pathology in recent years, there are still crucial gaps in the knowledge of the disease ecology, notably in how the parasite affects host performance in the wild. We sampled juvenile (0+) brown trout (Salmo trutta) from the wild during early and late summer and assessed relative parasite load (DNA quantification with qPCR) and disease severity (kidney hyperplasia). We also measured haematocrit, leucocyte formula, aerobic scope and upper thermal tolerance in a field-physiology approach in order to better understand the relationships between PKD severity and host performance. By using wild-caught individuals and performing measurements directly on location, we aimed to gain insights into host physiology in a natural environment while avoiding biases caused by laboratory acclimation. We found that most physiopathological symptoms in the wild were strongly correlated with kidney hyperplasia, but more weakly linked to parasite load. Disease severity was positively correlated with anaemia and abundance of circulating thrombocytes, and negatively correlated with aerobic scope and thermal tolerance. Our results suggest that impaired aerobic performances and thermal tolerance in infected fish may potentially result in decreased host survival in the wild, especially in relation with predicted higher average summer temperatures and increased frequency of extreme events (summer heatwaves) in the context of global climate change.

AB  - Habitat conditions mediate the effects of climate, so neighboring populations with differing habitat conditions may differ in their responses to climate change. We have previously observed that juvenile survival in Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon is strongly correlated with summer temperature in some populations and with fall streamflow in others. Here, we explore potential differential responses of the viability of four of these populations to changes in streamflow and temperature that might result from climate change. First, we linked predicted changes in air temperature and precipitation from several General Circulation Models to a local hydrological model to project streamflow and air temperature under two climate-change scenarios. Then, we developed a stochastic, density-dependent life-cycle model with independent environmental effects in juvenile and ocean stages, and parameterized the model for each population. We found that mean abundance decreased 20–50% and the probability of quasi-extinction increased dramatically (from 0.1–0.4 to 0.3–0.9) for all populations in both scenarios. Differences between populations were greater in the more moderate climate scenario than in the more extreme, hot/dry scenario. Model results were relatively robust to realistic uncertainty in freshwater survival parameters in all scenarios. Our results demonstrate that detailed population models can usefully incorporate climatechange predictions, and that global warming poses a direct threat to freshwater stages in these fish, increasing their risk of extinction. Because differences in habitat may contribute to the individualistic population responses we observed, we infer thatmaintaining habitat diversity will help buffer some species from the impacts of climate change.

AB  - Global warming may impose severe risks for aquatic animal health if increasing water temperature leads to an increase in the incidence of parasitic diseases. Essentially, this could take place through a temperature-driven effect on the epidemiology of the disease. For example, higher temperature may boost the rate of disease spread through positive effects on parasite fitness in a weakened host. Increased temperature may also lengthen the transmission season leading to higher total prevalence of infection and more widespread epidemics. However, to date, general understanding of these relationships is limited due to scarcity of long-term empirical data. Here, we present one of the first long-term multi-pathogen data sets on the occurrence of pathogenic bacterial and parasitic infections in relation to increasing temperatures in aquatic systems. We analyse a time-series of disease dynamics on two fish farms in northern Finland from 1986 to 2006. We first demonstrate that the annual mean water temperature increased significantly on both farms over the study period and that the increase was most pronounced in the late summer (July-September). Second, we show that the prevalence of infection (i.e. proportion of fish tanks infected each year) increased with temperature. Interestingly, this pattern was observed in some of the diseases (Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Flavobacterium columnare), whereas in the other diseases, the pattern was the opposite (Ichthyobodo necator) or absent (Chilodonella spp.). These results demonstrate the effect of increasing water temperature on aquatic disease dynamics, but also emphasise the importance of the biology of each disease, as well as the role of local conditions, in determining the direction and magnitude of these effects. © 2010 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

AB  - The life-histories of exploited fish species, such as Pacific salmon, are vulnerable to a wide variety of anthropogenic stressors including climate change, selective exploitation and competition with hatchery releases for finite foraging resources. However, these stressors may generate unexpected changes in life-histories due to developmental linkages when species complete their migratory life cycle in different habitats. We used multivariate time-series models to quantify changes in the prevalence of different life-history strategies of sockeye salmon from Bristol Bay, Alaska, over the past half-century—specifically, how they partition their lives between freshwater habitats and the ocean. Climate warming has decreased the time spent by salmon in their natal freshwater habitat, as climate-enhanced growth opportunities have enabled earlier migration to the ocean. Migration from freshwater at a younger age, and increasing competition from wild and hatchery-released salmon, have tended to delay maturation toward the salmon spending an additional year feeding in the ocean. Models evaluating the effects of size-selective fishing on these patterns had only small support. These stressors combine to reduce the size-at-age of fish vulnerable to commercial fisheries and have increasingly favoured a single-age class, potentially affecting the age class complexity that stabilizes this highly reliable resource.

AB  - Co-infections are very common in nature and occur when hosts are infected by two or more different pathogens either by simultaneous or secondary infections so that two or more infectious agents are active together in the same host. Co-infections have a fundamental effect and can alter the course and the severity of different fish diseases. However, co-infection effect has still received limited scrutiny in aquatic animals like fish and available data on this subject is still scarce. The susceptibility of fish to different pathogens could be changed during mixed infections causing the appearance of sudden fish outbreaks. In this review, we focus on the synergistic and antagonistic interactions occurring during co-infections by homologous or heterologous pathogens. We present a concise summary about the present knowledge regarding co-infections in fish. More research is needed to better understand the immune response of fish during mixed infections as these could have an important impact on the development of new strategies for disease control programs and vaccination in fish.

AB  - Most ecological processes now show responses to anthropogenic climate change. In terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems, species are changing genetically, physiologically, morphologically, and phenologically and are shifting their distributions, which affects food webs and results in new interactions. Disruptions scale from the gene to the ecosystem and have documented consequences for people, including unpredictable fisheries and crop yields, loss of genetic diversity in wild crop varieties, and increasing impacts of pests and diseases. In addition to the more easily observed changes, such as shifts in flowering phenology, we argue that many hidden dynamics, such as genetic changes, are also taking place. Understanding shifts in ecological processes can guide human adaptation strategies. In addition to reducing greenhouse gases, climate action and policy must therefore focus equally on strategies that safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems.

AB  - Emerging diseases are impacting animals under high-density culture, yet few studies assess their importance to wild populations. Microparasites selected for enhanced virulence in culture settings should be less successful maintaining infectivity in wild populations, as once the host dies, there are limited opportunities to infect new individuals. Instead, moderately virulent microparasites persisting for long periods across multiple environments are of greatest concern. Evolved resistance to endemic microparasites may reduce susceptibilities, but as barriers to microparasite distributions are weakened, and environments become more stressful, unexposed populations may be impacted and pathogenicity enhanced. We provide an overview of the evolutionary and ecological impacts of infectious diseases in wild salmon and suggest ways in which modern technologies can elucidate the microparasites of greatest potential import. We present four case studies that resolve microparasite impacts on adult salmon migration success, impact of river warming on microparasite replication, and infection status on susceptibility to predation. Future health of wild salmon must be considered in a holistic context that includes the cumulative or synergistic impacts of multiple stressors. These approaches will identify populations at greatest risk, critically needed to manage and potentially ameliorate the shifts in current or future trajectories of wild populations. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Sea-level rise and climatic change threaten the existence of atoll nations. Inundation and erosion are expected to render islands uninhabitable over the next century, forcing human migration. Here we present analysis of shoreline change in all 101 islands in the Pacific atoll nation of Tuvalu. Using remotely sensed data, change is analysed over the past four decades, a period when local sea level has risen at twice the global average (~3.90 ± 0.4 mm.yr-1). Results highlight a net increase in land area in Tuvalu of 73.5 ha (2.9%), despite sea-level rise, and land area increase in eight of nine atolls. Island change has lacked uniformity with 74% increasing and 27% decreasing in size. Results challenge perceptions of island loss, showing islands are dynamic features that will persist as sites for habitation over the next century, presenting alternate opportunities for adaptation that embrace the heterogeneity of island types and their dynamics.

AB  - Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are almost certain. What these outcomes mean for different populations, however, is far less certain. Climate change is both a narrative and material phenomenon. In so being, understanding climate change requires broad conceptualisations that incorporate multiple voices and recognise the agency of vulnerable populations. In climate change discourse, climate mobility is often characterised as the production of 'refugees', with a tendency to discount long histories of ordinary mobility among affected populations. The case of Tuvalu in the Pacific juxtaposes migration as everyday practice with climate refugee narratives. This climate-exposed population is being problematically positioned to speak for an entire planet under threat. Tuvaluans are being used as the immediate evidence of displacement that the climate change crisis narrative seems to require. Those identified as imminent climate refugees are being held up like ventriloquists to present a particular (western) 'crisis of nature'. Yet Tuvaluan conceptions of climate challenges and mobility practices show that more inclusive sets of concepts and tools are needed to equitably and effectively approach and characterise population mobility. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the past two decades there have been fears that many low-lying atoll islands around the world could disappear as a consequence of climate change and sea level rise, leading to mass migration and threatening the existence of several island nations. Here we show how sea level rise does not inevitably lead to coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, and that humans have an innate and often underestimated capacity to adapt to changes in their environment. To do so we showcase three instances of human- and earthquake-induced land subsidence that have taken place in the 21st century, where the coastal/island areas are still inhabited despite the challenge of living with higher water levels: the Tohoku coastline following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami (subsidence ∼0.4–1.0 m), the present day situation of coastal areas in Jakarta due to ground water extraction (>5.0 m), and the islands of Tubigon, Bohol in central Philippines after the 2013 Bohol Earthquake (∼1.0 m). Humans are able to adapt and arrive at solutions even when confronted with cases of rapid rises in water levels, and thus it is likely that in the future vulnerable coastlines will be engineered and largely remain at present day locations, particularly in densely populated areas. If anything, around densely populated areas it is more likely that humans will continue to encroach on the sea rather than the reverse. We caution, however, that small islands are not homogeneous, and many are unlikely to respond to rising sea levels in the manner that atolls do (in fact, many might just resort to build at higher elevations). Where engineering and other adaptation responses become necessary, the financial and human resource requirements may well be beyond capacity of some small islands, which could lead to impoverishment and associated challenges in many communities.

AB  - The geological stability and existence of low-lying atoll nations is threatened by sea-level rise and climate change. Funafuti Atoll, in the tropical Pacific Ocean, has experienced some of the highest rates of sea-level rise (~5.1 ± 0.7 mm/yr), totaling ~0.30 ± 0.04 m over the past 60 yr. We analyzed six time slices of shoreline position over the past 118 yr at 29 islands of Funafuti Atoll to determine their physical response to recent sea-level rise. Despite the magnitude of this rise, no islands have been lost, the majority have enlarged, and there has been a 7.3% increase in net island area over the past century (A.D. 1897-2013). There is no evidence of heightened erosion over the past half-century as sea-level rise accelerated. Reef islands in Funafuti continually adjust their size, shape, and position in response to variations in boundary conditions, including storms, sediment supply, as well as sea level. Results suggest a more optimistic prognosis for the habitability of atoll nations and demonstrate the importance of resolving recent rates and styles of island change to inform adaptation strategies.

AB  - Politicians, scientists, government agencies, and the public are all engaged in recovery planning for Pacific salmon. In order for science to fulfill its potential in the arena of salmon recovery planning, several shortcomings of the science and its application to decision-making must be rectified. The definition of conservation units using genetic and phylogenetic inference needs to be sharpened. Ecological analyses must get beyond casting blame for past declines in salmon numbers and examine mixed strategies of management that consider interactions between hatcheries, harvest, hydropower, and habitat factors as well as background natural stresses and invasive species. Glib acceptance of expert opinion and extrapolated or inferred data should be tempered. To deal with uncertainty, recovery teams should engage in scenario analyses in which a wide variety of assumptions are played out. Finally, there is a pressing need for analyses aimed at determining what circumstances and communication strategies give science an effective voice in decision-making.

AB  - If, like other ecosystems, the variable and dynamic ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest exhibited cycles and unpredictable behavior, particularly when humans were present, the indigenous societies of that region had to have been resilient in order to persist for such a long time. They persisted for two millennia prior to contact with people from the "old world." The Resilience Alliance (2002) proposes that social and ecological resilience requires three abilities: the ability to buffer, the ability to self-organize, and the ability to learn. This paper suggests that the characteristics of the potlatch system among Indians on the Northwest Coast, namely property rights, environmental ethics, rules of earning and holding titles, public accountability, and the reciprocal exchange system, provided all three required abilities. The resulting resilience of these societies confirms the validity of many of the ideas now being discussed as important components in providing successful and sustainable relationships between humans and their ecosystems. That so many separate ideas seem to have been linked together into resilient systems in the Pacific Northwest suggests that social ecological resilience is complicated. © 2003 by the author(s).

AB  - This dissertation explores the link between civil-military relations and international conflict. In particular, I ask whether strategies that leaders invoke to protect themselves from their own militaries might under some conditions increase the risk of war. Even though civil-military relations is fundamental to state-building, and despite the sizable literature on domestic causes of international conflict, there is very little work on the international implications of regimes' efforts to protect themselves from their own militaries. My argument is that when coups are possible, usually leaders divide their armed forces into rival organizations that they intend to check and balance each other and protect the regime as a by-product of mutual suspicion. (I label this strategy counterbalancing). Counterbalancing depends on leaders' ability to keep their own armed forces apart by promoting conflict among them. But military elites may rebel if they come to understand how leaders profit from inter-organizational hostility. Hence, counterbalancing requires leaders to conceal control benefits they accrue when they induce their own forces to compete. Because international conflict conceals these benefits, leaders may invent enemies, prepare for war, and engage in low-level international disputes when their foundational objective is to use counterbalancing to subordinate their own militaries. Contrary to the sizable literature on scapegoating, my argument is that in the realm of civil-military relations regimes may use provocative foreign policy to reinforce institutional divisions rather than to achieve cohesion. The argument is tested via a multi-method strategy that includes a pooled, time-series analysis of almost every country in the world over the last two decades of the Cold War as well as historical case studies of civil-military relations in Syria in the early 1970's and Georgia in the mid-1990's.

AB  - Vaccination is considered crucial for disease prevention and fish health in the global salmon farming industry. Nevertheless, some aspects, such as the efficacy of vaccines, can be largely circumvented during natural coinfections. Sea lice are ectoparasitic copepods that can occur with a high prevalence in the field, are frequently found in co-infection with other pathogens, and are highly detrimental to fish health. The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate the interaction between the detrimental effects of coinfection and the protective effects of vaccination in fish. We used the interaction between the sea louse Caligus rogercresseyi, the bacterial pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis, and their host, the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, as a study model. Our results showed that coinfection decreased the accumulated survival (AS) and specific growth rate (SGR) of vaccinated fish (AS = 5.2 ± 0.6%; SGR = -0.05 ± 0.39%) compared to a single infection of P. salmonis (AS = 42.7 ± 1.3%; SGR = 0.21 ± 0.22%). Concomitantly, the bacterial load and clinical signs of disease were significantly increased in coinfected fish. Coinfection may explain the reduced efficacy of vaccines in sea cages and highlights the need to test fish vaccines in more diverse conditions rather than with a single infection.

AB  - Salmon are inherently resilient species. However, this resiliency has been undermined in British Columbia by a century of centralized, command-and-control management focused initially on maximizing yield and, more recently, on economic efficiency. Community and cultural resiliency have also been undermined, especially by the recent emphasis on economic efficiency, which has concentrated access in the hands of a few and has disenfranchised fishery-dependent communities. Recent declines in both salmon stocks and salmon prices have revealed the systemic failure of the current management system. If salmon and their fisheries are to become viable again, radically new management policies are needed. For the salmon species, the emphasis must shift from maximizing yield to restoring resilience; for salmon fisheries, the emphasis must shift from maximizing economic efficiency to maximizing community and cultural resilience. For the species, an approach is needed that integrates harvest management, habitat management, and habitat enhancement to sustain and enhance resilience. This is best achieved by giving fishing and aboriginal communities greater responsibility and authority to manage the fisheries on which they depend. Co-management arrangements that involve cooperative ownership of major multistock resources like the Fraser River and Skeena River fisheries and community-based quota management of smaller fisheries provide ways to put species conservation much more directly in the hands of the communities most dependent on the well-being and resilience of these fisheries. © 2009 by the author(s).

AB  - On October 11, 2018, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Coast Guard, released the Wild Salmon Policy 2018-2022 Implementation Plan (the Plan). This document outlines 9 overarching approaches and 48 actions the Department is committed to undertaking and leading on over the next five years in order to implement Canada’s Policy for Conservation of Wild Pacific Salmon – also known as the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP). In the spirit of ‘what gets measured, gets done’, and in line with the Government of Canada’s commitment to openness and transparency, the Plan includes DFO’s commitment to performance review, including annual public reporting on the status and progress of key actions. While annual review of work plans and post-season operations happens as a normal course of business, the public reporting on the status of activities in the Plan keeps partners and the public informed of progress in a timely manner, provides early warning of challenges that need to be addressed, and reflects on lessons learned. Over 2018-19, the Department has completed or made progress on all the overarching approaches and a number of key activitiesin the Plan that advance monitoring of wild salmon stocks, habitat and ecosystem assessment and monitoring, integrated strategic planning, program delivery, and continued collaboration with the Province of BC, First Nations, and other stakeholders.

AB  - Piscine orthoreovirus Strain PRV-1 is the causative agent of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation
(HSMI) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Linnaeus, 1758). Given its high prevalence in net
pen salmon, debate has arisen on whether PRV poses a risk to migratory salmon, especially in
British Columbia (BC) where commercially important wild Pacific salmon are in decline.
Various strains of PRV have been associated with diseases in Pacific salmon, including erythrocytic
inclusion body syndrome (EIBS), HSMI-like disease, and jaundice/anemia in Japan,
Norway, Chile and Canada. We examined the developmental pathway of HSMI and jaundice/
anemia associated with PRV-1 in farmed Atlantic and chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha
(Walbaum, 1792)) salmon in BC, respectively. In situ hybridization localized PRV-1 within developing
lesions in both diseases. The two diseases showed dissimilar pathological pathways, with
inflammatory lesions in heart and skeletal muscle in Atlantic salmon and degenerative-necrotic
lesions in kidney and liver in chinook salmon, plausibly explained by differences in PRV load tolerance
in red blood cells. Viral genome sequencing revealed no consistent differences in PRV-1
variants intimately involved in the development of both diseases suggesting that migratory chinook
salmon may be at more than a minimal risk of disease from exposure to the high levels of
PRV occurring in salmon farms.

AB  - Managing natural resources in an era of increasing climate impacts requires accounting for the synergistic effects of climate, ecosystem changes, and harvesting on resource productivity. Coincident with recent exceptional warming of the northwest Atlantic Ocean and removal of large predatory fish, the American lobster has become the most valuable fishery resource in North America. Using a model that links ocean temperature, predator density, and fishing to population productivity, we show that harvester-driven conservation efforts to protect large lobsters prepared the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery to capitalize on favorable ecosystem conditions, resulting in the record-breaking landings recently observed in the region. In contrast, in the warmer southern New England region, the absence of similar conservation efforts precipitated warming-induced recruitment failure that led to the collapse of the fishery. Population projections under expected warming suggest that the American lobster fishery is vulnerable to future temperature increases, but continued efforts to preserve the stock’s reproductive potential can dampen the negative impacts of warming. This study demonstrates that, even though global climate change is severely impacting marine ecosystems, widely adopted, proactive conservation measures can increase the resilience of commercial fisheries to climate change.

AB  - The fundamental aspects of survey and sampling design in the deep sea are generally the same as in shallower shelf and coastal waters. However, limitations imposed by depth, topography and by the extra time required to survey large areas of the deep sea can be challenging. In this chapter we focus on some of the key elements that are required to plan a valid survey and sampling strategy. Particular attention needs to be directed at establishing clear objectives, and a strategy of fewer tasks carried out well is generally preferable to a larger number done too poorly to address or test hypotheses. Spatial sampling aspects of survey design need especially to consider replication, scale, dispersion and independence of sampling units, and to avoid confounding of multiple environmental factors. Several case studies are presented to illustrate some of these elements, and to help the reader become familiar with practical aspects of biodiversity surveys, abundance surveys, surveys directed at ecological function, surveys that take a wide 'ecosystem' view, and the benefits of long-term time series. This chapter is not meant to be a comprehensive account of survey design, but addresses some of the most important elements a researcher should be aware of.

AB  - Sea lice, especially Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus spp., have the greatest economic impact of any parasite in salmonid fish farming and are also a threat to wild salmonids. Here, I review how the biology and ecology of various louse and host species influence their pathogenicity and epidemiology. Recent discoveries of new species and genotypes emphasize the need for more basic research on louse taxonomy and host preferences. Louse development rates are strongly dependent on temperature, and increasing mean sea temperatures are likely to increase infestation pressure on farms and wild fish, as well as affecting the geographical distribution of hosts and parasites. Despite progress in finding L. salmonis larvae in the plankton and in modelling louse production in several countries, more data on larval behaviour and distribution are required to develop dispersal and transmission models for both L. salmonis and Caligus spp. This knowledge could be used to take measures to reduce the risks of lice affecting farmed and wild fish. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Coastal and epipelagic cephalopods are among the fastest growing invertebrates, with life cycles of typically 1 year or less. Evidence is accumulating that deep-sea taxa often live longer and grow slower than their shallow water relatives. We test the hypothesis that deep-sea squid show increased longevity and reduced growth rates compared to coastal and epipelagic species, by validation experiments and quantification of statolith increments of three deep-sea squids from the Monterey Submarine Canyon. The periodicity of statolith increment formation in coastal species is daily, but is unknown for deep-sea squid. Between 2010 and 2013, specimens of Chiroteuthis calyx, Galiteuthis phyllura and Octopoteuthis deletron were captured by remotely operated vehicles and trawl nets off California. ROV-captured living squid were immersed in tetracycline and kept alive in the lab for between 3 and 14 days. Correlating the number of elapsed days with the number of newly deposited statolith increments, and statolith growth after the fluorescent tetracycline mark, provided evidence of regular and daily increment deposition, in C. calyx and O. deletron. This relationship was less strong in G. phyllura and the one-increment-per-day hypothesis was not accepted for this species. Reconstructing growth rates based on statolith counts and wet weights from animals of a wide size range suggest that O. deletron is a slower growing squid (0.59% BW/day) than C. calyx (1.3% BW/day) and G. phyllura (1.2% BW/day). Octopoteuthis deletron matures at around two years, the oldest C. calyx was a mature male of 1.5 years and the eldest G. phyllura was 10 months and still immature. Maximum reported sizes for G. phyllura and C. calyx exceed those of our examined specimens, and therefore their longevity likely exceeds 2 years, in particular if the females brood their eggs. Our study supports the hypothesis that deeper living squid exhibit reduced growth rates and an increased longevity compared to shallow living species. We discuss these traits in the context of a life in the deep pelagic ocean.

AB  - The salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis is a common ectoparasite of both farmed and wild salmonids in the marine environment, and can have a significant negative effect on the survival and growth of its host. To facilitate development of models of salmon lice population dynamics, we review the available experimental information on its demographic rates and highlight areas where further research is needed. For all stages, the reduced minimum development time of a stage with increasing water temperature (T) was well described by Belehrádek's function. However, detailed experimental studies of the development of the parasitic stages at low (T < 7°C) and high (T > 15°C) water temperatures are needed to cover the whole range of water temperatures experienced in the wild. Little information was available on mortality rates and distributions of developmental times after the initial minimum developmental times. These parameters could only be estimated for a narrow temperature range, but the available estimates suggested that distributions of development times may be assumed to be constant with respect to temperature. Factors affecting female fecundity are presently poorly understood, with a level of unexplained variability in both average egg numbers per string and egg viability, which demands further investigations. In addition, experiments on possible density-dependent effects on salmon lice fecundity and survival are required. © Inter-Research 2005.

AB  - In the development of integrated pest management (IPM) plans for the control of sea lice there are some components that are common to many areas. However, effective plans must be tailored to regionally varying environmental and biological factors affecting the severity of sea lice infections. This paper describes factors that would be involved in the development of an IPM plan for sea lice in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia. Temperature, salinity and currents affect the production, dispersion and competence of larvae of sea lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Krøyer), as they develop to the infective copepodid stage. This information can be coupled with oceanographic conditions in the Broughton Archipelago and emerging computer models to define zones of infection where infections of new hosts are most likely. Salinity and temperature depend, in part, on river discharge in estuarine systems. River discharge depends on precipitation, snow pack and ambient temperatures, which can be monitored to help forecast the intensity of sea lice infections associated with both farmed and wild hosts. One of the goals of IPM planning is to reduce reliance on pesticides to avoid development of resistance in targeted parasites and to minimize environmental residues. Recommendations for developing an IPM plan specific to the Broughton Archipelago are provided along with a discussion of the additional information needed to refine IPM plans in this and other areas. 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) of fish-farm origin have been implicated in reducing populations of pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in British Columbia's Broughton Archipelago. Owing to the physically disruptive nature of louse attachment to fish skin in a hyperosmotic environment, we hypothesize that the impacts on fish performance are ionoregulatory in origin. Therefore, ionoregulatory status was measured in juvenile pink salmon artificially infected in the laboratory and naturally infected in the wild. Body [Na +] of laboratory-infected fish (~1 week seawater (SW); 0.2-0.4 g) increased significantly by 12% with a single chalimus-4 louse, and by 23% with 2-3 chalimus-3 lice. Mortality over this 24-day trial was 2.4% for fish initially infected with 1-3 lice. Body [Na +] for fish caught with natural infections (~4-12 weeks SW; 0.5-1.5 g) did not differ from uninfected controls. Combining data sets revealed a "no effect" threshold of 0.5 g for body [Na +] of fish infected with one chalimus-4 louse. We propose that this size-related louse tolerance is associated with hypo-osmoregulatory development, adding to a previously suggested multifactorial mechanism based on epidermal and immune system development. We suggest management bodies consider this fish-mass threshold when planning to minimize risk to wild fish populations.

AB  - Why are parasites ecologically important? Parasites can shape community structure through their effects on trophic interactions, food webs, competition, biodiversity, and keystone species. The ecological interactions of parasites (defined here to include both macroparasites and microparasites) are often challenging to observe. Many live their lives secretively, in intimate contact with their host, but invisible to the outside world. With some notable exceptions (e.g., tapeworms), parasites also tend to be very small. It may be easy to assume then, that since parasites are generally inconspicuous, they play less important roles in community ecology than free­living organisms. Yet advances in the field of disease ecology have revealed that parasites are not only ecologically important, but can sometimes exert influences that equal or surpass those of free­living species in shaping community structure. In fact parasitism is more common than traditional predation as a consumer lifestyle (De Meeûs & Renaud 2002), and arguably represents the most widespread life­history strategy in nature (Price 1980). Parasites also influence host behavior and fitness, and can regulate host population sizes, sometimes with profound effects on trophic interactions, food webs, competition, biodiversity and keystone species. These interactions suggest that parasites are integral components in shaping community­ and ecosystem structure.

AB  - Host–parasite coevolution is widely assumed to have a major influence on biological evolution, especially as these interactions impose high selective pressure on the reciprocally interacting antagonists. The exact nature of the underlying dynamics is yet under debate and may be determined by recurrent selective sweeps (i.e., arms race dynamics), negative frequency-dependent selection (i.e., Red Queen dynamics), or a combination thereof. These interactions are often associated with reciprocally induced changes in population size, which, in turn, should have a strong impact on co-adaptation processes, yet are neglected in most current work on the topic. Here, we discuss potential consequences of temporal variations in population size on host–parasite coevolution. The limited empirical data available and the current theoretical literature in this field highlight that the consideration of such interaction-dependent population size changes is likely key for the full understanding of the coevolutionary dynamics, and, thus, a more realistic view on the complex nature of species interactions.

AB  - This paper reviews the work published over the past decade on the use of parasites as biological tags in population studies of marine fish, mammals and invertebrates. Fish hosts are considered in taxonomic and ecological groups as follows: demersal, anadromous, small pelagic, large pelagic and elasmobranch. Most studies were carried out on demersal fish, particularly on members of the genera Merluccius (hake), Sebastes (rockfish) and on Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L., but Pacific salmonids and small pelagic fish of the genus Trachurus are also well-represented. A current multidisciplinary study of the population biology of horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus in European waters, which includes the use of parasites as tags, is described. Two studies recognize the potential for using parasites as tags for cetaceans but, in spite of the considerable potential for this approach in population studies of elasmobranchs, no original study has been carried out on this group for over ten years. Studies of parasites as tags for marine invertebrates have concentrated on squid. Recent trends in the use of parasites as biological tags for marine hosts are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Soft robots offer many advantages over traditional rigid robots. However, soft robots can be difficult to control with standard control methods. Fortunately, evolutionary algorithms can offer an elegant solution to this problem. Instead of creating controls to handle the intricate dynamics of these robots, we can simply evolve the controls using a simulation to provide an evaluation function. In this article, we show how such a control paradigm can be applied to an emerging field within soft robotics: robots based on tensegrity structures. We take the model of the Spherical Underactuated Planetary Exploration Robot ball (SUPERball), an icosahedron tensegrity robot under production at NASA Ames Research Center, develop a rolling locomotion algorithm, and study the learned behavior using an accurate model of the SUPERball simulated in the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit. We first present the historical- average fitness-shaping algorithm for coevolutionary algorithms to speed up learning while favoring robustness over optimality. Second, we use a distributed control approach by coevolving open-loop control signals for each controller. Being simple and distributed, open-loop controllers can be readily implemented on SUPERball hardware without the need for sensor information or precise coordination. We analyze signals of different complexities and frequencies. Among the learned policies, we take one of the best and use it to analyze different aspects of the rolling gait, such as lengths, tensions, and energy consumption. We also discuss the correlation between the signals controlling different parts of the tensegrity robot. A

AB  - BACKGROUND We prospectively investigated the association between different measures of smoking exposure and the risk of serous, mucinous, and endometrioid ovarian cancers (OC) in a cohort of more than 300 000 Norwegian women. METHODS We followed 300 398 women aged 19-67 years at enrolment until 31 December 2013 for OC incidence through linkage to national registries. We used Cox proportional hazards models with attained age as the underlying time scale to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for relevant confounders. RESULTS During more than 5.9 million person-years and a median follow-up time of 19 years, 2336 primary invasive (1647, 71%) and borderline (689, 29%) OC were identified (53% serous, 19% mucinous). Compared with never smokers, current smokers who had smoked for ⩾10 years had a higher risk of mucinous OC (HR10-19 years vs never=1.73, 95% CI 1.24-2.42; HR⩾20 vs never=2.26, 95% CI 1.77-2.89, Ptrend <0.001). When stratified by invasiveness, current smokers had a higher risk of invasive mucinous OC (HR=1.78, 95% CI 1.20-2.64) and borderline mucinous OC (HR=2.26 95% CI, 1.71-2.97) (Pheterogeneity=0.34) than never smokers. Smoking was not associated with serous or endometrioid OC. CONCLUSIONS Using a very large cohort of women, the current analysis provides an important replication for a similar risk of invasive and borderline mucinous OC related to smoking.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 13 December 2016. doi:10.1038/bjc.2016.418 www.bjcancer.com.

AB  - We review current ideas about coevolution of plants and parasites, particularly processes that generate genetic diversity. Frequencies of host resistance and parasite virulence alleles that interact in gene-for-gene (GFG) relationships coevolve in the familiar boom-and-bust cycle, in which resistance is selected when virulence is rare, and virulence is selected when resistance is common. The cycle can result in stable polymorphism when diverse ecological and epidemiological factors cause negative direct frequency-dependent selection (ndFDS) on host resistance, parasite virulence, or both, such that the benefit of a trait to fitness declines as its frequency increases. Polymorphism can also be stabilized by overdominance, when heterozygous hosts have greater resistance than homozygotes to diverse pathogens. Genetic diversity can also persist in the form of statistical polymorphism, sustained by random processes acting on gene frequencies and population size. Stable polymorphism allows alleles to be long-lived and genetic variation to be detectable in natural populations. In agriculture, many of the factors promoting stability in host-parasite interactions have been lost, leading to arms races of host defenses and parasite effectors.

AB  - The co‐evolutionary process is believed to have resulted, through interaction of wild populations of potato cyst nematodes and their hosts in geological time, in the resistant hosts now utilized in plant breeding programmes and in nematode populations with genes for resistance‐breaking or virulence. It is argued that all such interactions between highly adapted, truly parasitic plant nematodes and their hosts are likely to be governed by gene‐for‐gene interrelationships. Practical implications of this hypothesis are that only pathotypes (resistance‐breaking races) defined against identified resistance genes are scientifically sound and of practical value; that, in the case of potato cyst nematodes, other pathotypes (Ro2, Ro3, Ro5 and Pa2 and Pa3) should be abandoned; and that oligogenically based resistance to potato cyst nematodes, especially important in providing resistance to Globodera pallida, is non‐durable. Working definitions of the terms ‘pathotype’, ‘host‐race’ and ‘virulence’ are provided. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Why sexual reproduction is so common despite major costs remains a widely debated evolutionary question. One of the most plausible potential explanations is the Red Queen hypothesis, which proposes that coevolving parasites can generate a selective advantage for sex. This hypothesis predicts that sexual reproduction should be most common where individuals experience a relatively high risk of parasitic infection. Here, we test this prediction at a very fine spatial scale by evaluating whether variation in the frequency of infection by sterilising trematode parasites within a single New Zealand lake population is positively associated with similar variation in the relative frequency of sexually vs. asexually reproducing Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a native New Zealand snail. We found that sexual snails were significantly more common in sites within the lake that were subject to a higher frequency of parasite infection, consistent with the prediction of the Red Queen hypothesis. This result extends previous research on the connection between sexual reproduction and infection in P. antipodarum to a new lake and a finer spatial scale than previously documented.

AB  - Gaining insight in likely disease emergence scenarios is critical to preventing such events from happening. Recent focus has been on emerging zoonoses and on identifying common patterns and drivers of emerging diseases. However, no overarching framework exists to integrate knowledge on all emerging infectious disease events. Here, we propose such a conceptual framework based on changes in the interplay of pathogens, hosts and environment that lead to the formation of novel disease patterns and pathogen genetic adjustment. We categorize infectious disease emergence events into three groups: (i) pathogens showing up in a novel host, ranging from spill-over, including zoonoses, to complete species jumps; (ii) mutant pathogens displaying novel traits in the same host, including an increase in virulence, antimicrobial resistance and host immune escape; and (iii) disease complexes emerging in a new geographic area, either through range expansion or through long distance jumps. Each of these categories is characterized by a typical set of drivers of emergence, matching pathogen trait profiles, disease ecology and transmission dynamics. Our framework may assist in disentangling and structuring the rapidly growing amount of available information on infectious diseases. Moreover, it may contribute to a better understanding of how human action changes disease landscapes globally. © 2013 SSCC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Frequency distributions from 49 published wildlife host-macroparasite systems were analysed by maximum likelihood for goodness of fit to the negative binomial distribution. In 45 of the 49 (90%) data-sets, the negative binomial distribution provided a statistically satisfactory fit. In the other 4 data-sets the negative binomial distribution still provided a better fit than the Poisson distribution, and only 1 of the data-sets fitted the Poisson distribution. The degree of aggregation was large, with 43 of the 49 data-sets having an estimated k of less than 1. From these 49 data-sets, 22 subsets of host data were available (i.e. host data could be divided by either host sex, age, where or when hosts were sampled). In 11 of these 22 subsets there was significant variation in the degree of aggregation between host subsets of the same host-parasite system. A common k estimate was always larger than that obtained with all the host data considered together. These results indicate that lumping host data can hide important variations in aggregation between hosts and can exaggerate the true degree of aggregation. Wherever possible common k estimates should be used to estimate the degree of aggregation. In addition, significant differences in the degree of aggregation between subgroups of host data, were generally associated with significant differences in both mean parasite burdens and the prevalence of infection.

AB  - Parasites and their infections can adversely effect a host's growth, reproduction and survival. These effects are often not immediate, but increase with time since infection. A general prediction from evolutionary biology is that hosts suffering from this type of infection should preferentially allocate resources towards reproduction, even if this is at the expense of their growth and survival. This review illustrates this argument with several empirical studies showing hosts behaving in this manner. These studies indicate that one way for hosts to reduce the costs of parasitism is by altering their life history traits to bring forward their schedule of reproduction.

AB  - Counter to expectations of coevolved parasite-host relationships, parasites frequently infect hosts that never contribute to their reproduction, making the identification of a parasite's true host-specificity problematic. Pseudodelphis oligocotti (Nematoda: Dracunculoidea) infects several coastal Pacific fishes, but its course of development appears highly variable, suggesting that incidence does not reflect effective host range. To determine the host range of P. oligocotti and describe its relationship to various potential hosts, 24 fish species were examined from several British Columbia localities for prevalence, intensity, and extent and tissue location of parasite development. Pseudodelphis oligocotti infects 9 species of fishes from 5 orders, of which penpoint gunnel, Apodichthys flavidus, showed the highest prevalence and intensity, up to 80% and 19 (+/- 17.1 SD) worms per host, respectively. Although subadult and adult P. oligocotti occurred in all 9 fishes, larvigerous P. oligocotti only occurred in A. flavidus and rarely in the northern clingfish, Gobiesox maeandricus. Infective first-stage larvae were recovered from gill tissue of A. flavidus. Thus, at most only 2 of the 9 host species infected by P. oligocotti actually contribute to its transmission. The occurrence of P. oligocotti in diverse hosts may be accounted for by the parasite's indiscriminant mode of transmission via ingestion of free-living intermediate copepod hosts, where highly exposed or more suitable fishes (or both) are closely related by diet and microhabitat. This study demonstrates how parasite transmission and host ecology can greatly affect observed host range and ultimately its potential for expansion.

AB  - A comprehensive literature review identifies 1415 species of infectious organism known to be pathogenic to humans, including 217 viruses and prions, 538 bacteria and rickettsia, 307 fungi, 66 protozoa and 287 helminths. Out of these, 868 (61%) are zoonotic, that is, they can be transmitted between humans and animals, and 175 pathogenic species are associated with diseases considered to be 'emerging'. We test the hypothesis that zoonotic pathogens are more likely to be associated with emerging diseases than non-emerging ones. Out of the emerging pathogens, 132 (75%) are zoonotic, and overall, zoonotic pathogens are twice as likely to be associated with emerging diseases than non-zoonotic pathogens. However, the result varies among taxa, with protozoa and viruses particularly likely to emerge, and helminths particularly unlikely to do so, irrespective of their zoonotic status. No association between transmission route and emergence was found. This study represents the first quantitative analysis identifying risk factors for human disease emergence.

AB  - Host population thresholds for the invasion or persistence of infectious disease are core concepts of disease ecology and underlie disease control policies based on culling and vaccination. However, empirical evidence for these thresholds in wildlife populations has been sparse, although recent studies have begun to address this gap. Here, we review the theoretical bases and empirical evidence for disease thresholds in wildlife. We see that, by their nature, these thresholds are rarely abrupt and always difficult to measure, and important facets of wildlife ecology are neglected by current theories. Empirical studies seeking to identify disease thresholds in wildlife encounter recurring obstacles of small sample sizes and confounding factors. Disease control policies based solely on threshold targets are rarely warranted, but management to reduce abundance of susceptible hosts can be effective. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Livestock feed modification is a viable method for reducing methane emissions from ruminant livestock. Ruminant enteric methane is responsible approximately to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. Some species of macroalgae have antimethanogenic activity on in vitro fermentation. This study used in vitro fermentation with rumen inoculum to characterise increasing inclusion rates of the red macroalga Asparagopsis taxiformis on enteric methane production and digestive efficiency throughout 72-h fermentations. At dose levels ≤1% of substrate organic matter there was minimal effect on gas and methane production. However, inclusion ≥2% reduced gas and eliminated methane production in the fermentations indicating a minimum inhibitory dose level. There was no negative impact on substrate digestibility for macroalgae inclusion ≤5%, however, a significant reduction was observed with 10% inclusion. Total volatile fatty acids were not significantly affected with 2% inclusion and the acetate levels were reduced in favour of increased propionate and, to a lesser extent, butyrate which increased linearly with increasing dose levels. A barrier to commercialisation of Asparagopsis is the mass production of this specific macroalgal biomass at a scale to provide supplementation to livestock. Another area requiring characterisation is the most appropriate method for processing (dehydration) and feeding to livestock in systems with variable feed quality and content. The in vitro assessment method used here clearly demonstrated that Asparagopsis can inhibit methanogenesis at very low inclusion levels whereas the effect in vivo has yet to be confirmed.

AB  - Parasitism is one of the most successful modes of life displayed by living organisms, as measured by how often it evolved and how many parasitic species are presently in existence. Studying the diversity of parasites is particularly relevant because sympatric diversification may be important in some parasite taxa, and because of the opportunity for independent tests of evolutionary hypotheses in the many separate lineages in which parasitism evolved. Our incomplete knowledge of existing parasite species - the result of a range of phenomena that includes inadequate sampling effort or the lumping of different cryptic species under one name - is not always a major obstacle for the study of parasite diversity. Patterns in the diversity of parasites may be associated with either host or parasite characteristics. The distribution of parasite diversity among host taxa does not simply reflect the species diversity of the host taxa themselves; life history and ecological traits of hosts appear to play important roles. These may determine the likelihood that hosts are colonized by parasite species over evolutionary time. It is not yet clear whether some host traits also favor intrahost speciation and diversification of parasites, and the formation of new parasite species. Certain features of parasites may also be associated with speciation and diversification. Only parasite body size has received much attention; the patterns observed are not greatly different from those of free-living species, with small-bodied parasite taxa being more speciose than related large-bodied taxa. Epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproductive rate of parasites, or R0, can also generate predictions regarding the distribution or evolution of parasite diversity. For instance, parasite taxa characterized by high R0 values may be more speciose than related taxa with lower values of R0; such predictions remain untested. Large-scale biogeographical patterns of diversity have only been well studied for metazoan parasites of marine fish; for these parasites, latitudinal patterns can be explained by effects of temperature on speciation rates and epidemiological variables, though other causes are possible. The emphasis for future research must shift from pattern description to the elucidation of the processes responsible for the structure and diversity of parasite faunas. A better integration of ecological and historical (or phylogenetic) approaches to the study of parasite diversity should make this objective possible.

The authors draw on feminist, trans, queer, critical race, Indigenous, decolonial, and posthuman theories in order to examine the relationships between origins, memories, place, identities, bodies, pasts, and futures. The chapters address a range of concerns, among them love, memory, weather, bodies, vulnerability, fog, myth, ice, desire, hauntings, and home. Autoethnography and Feminist Theory at the Water's Edge will be of interest to students and scholars across a range of disciplines including gender studies, cultural geography, folklore, and anthropology, as well as those working in autoethnography, life writing, and island studies.

AB  - Assortative mating occurs when there is a correlation (positive or negative) between male and female phenotypes or genotypes across mated pairs. To determine the typical strength and direction of assortative mating in animals, we carried out a metaanalysis of published measures of assortative mating for a variety of phenotypic and genotypic traits in a diverse set of animal taxa. We focused on the strength of assortment within populations, excluding reproductively isolated populations and species. We collected 1,116 published correlations between mated pairs from 254 species (360 unique species-trait combinations) in five phyla. The mean correlation between mates was 0.28, showing an overall tendency toward positive assortative mating within populations. Although 19% of the correlations were negative, simulations suggest that these could represent type I error and that negative assortative mating may be rare. We also find significant differences in the strength of assortment among major taxonomic groups and among trait categories. We discuss various possible reasons for the evolution of assortative mating and its implications for speciation. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - A person’s mental capacities, such as intellect, cannot be observed directly and so are instead inferred from indirect cues. We predicted that a person’s intellect would be conveyed most strongly through a cue closely tied to actual thinking: his or her voice. Hypothetical employers (Experiments 1–3b) and professional recruiters (Experiment 4) watched, listened to, or read job candidates’ pitches about why they should be hired. These evaluators rated a candidate as more competent, thoughtful, and intelligent when they heard a pitch rather than read it and, as a result, had a more favorable impression of the candidate and were more interested in hiring the candidate. Adding voice to written pitches, by having trained actors (Experiment 3a) or untrained adults (Experiment 3b) read them, produced the same results. Adding visual cues to audio pitches did not alter evaluations of the candidates. For conveying one’s intellect, it is important that one’s voice, quite literally, be heard.

AB  - The loss of sensitivity to emamectin benzoate recorded in Caligus rogercresseyi in the Region X in Chile (41°46'S72°56'W; 43°07'S73°38'W) has been attributed to the exclusive use of this product to control sea lice for more than seven years. In order to evaluate the sensitivity through successive generations of lice, a study was carried out between August 2006 and April 2007. Seven successive generations from a presumably resistant population of C. rogercresseyi were cultivated in the laboratory without the selection pressure of the antiparasitic drug. Results of the bioassay applied to the progenies showed that there was no recovery of sensitivity over the seven inbred generations studied. This may point to a long-standing resistance problem against emamectin benzoate.

AB  - Rapid evolution can increase or maintain the provision of ecosystem services, motivating the conservation of wild species and communities. We detail one such contemporary evosystem service by synthesizing theoretical evidence that rapid evolution can sustain parasiticide efficacy in salmon aquaculture, thus creating an added incentive for salmon conservation. Globally, wild and farmed salmon share native parasites: sea lice. In most major salmon farming areas sea lice have evolved resistance to parasiticides, but in the North Pacific, where farmed salmon coexist with large wild salmon populations, resistance has not emerged. We present a model to show that flow of susceptible genes from lice hosted on wild salmon to those hosted on farmed salmon can delay or preclude resistance. This theoretical and observational data suggests that wild salmon (both oceanic populations that function as a refuge and local migratory populations that connect this refuge to domesticated environments) provide an evosystem service by prolonging parasiticide efficacy. To preserve this service, aquaculture managers could avoid production quantities that exceed wild salmon abundances, and sustain wild salmon populations through regional and oceanic scale conservation. The evosystem service of resistance mitigation is one example of how a contemporary evolutionary process that benefits people can strengthen the case for conservation of intrinsically important wild species.

AB  - The ectoparasitic copepod Caligus rogercresseyi, as distributed in the south of Chile, is the most important parasite of farmed salmonids because of the substantial, negative effects on survival, growth and increased susceptibility to infections, and this results in severe economic effects in seawater aquaculture. The sensitivity of C. rogercresseyi to emamectin benzoate was studied in 18 salmon farms belonging to four large aquaculture companies in Chile. Emamectin benzoate is the only medicinal product allowed by the Chilean official authority for Caligus control since 2000. Sensitivity values, recorded as EC50 (the emamectin concentration immobilizing 50% of the test subjects) in adult C. rogercresseyi were between 57 and 203 micrograms per liter (ppb) in the survey carried out in the summer season, and between 202 and 870 ppb for the winter season survey. The EC50 control value, obtained from naïve Lepeophtheirus mugiloidis parasites, was 34 ppb. The results strongly indicate loss of sensitivity of C. rogercresseyi to emamectin benzoate at all sites analyzed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The avermectin derivative emamectin benzoate (EMB) has been widely used by salmon industries around the world to control sea lice infestations. Resistance to this anti-parasitic drug is also commonly reported in these industries. The objective of this study was to quantify the number of sea lice potentially exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of EMB while fish clear the drug after treatments. We assessed juvenile sea lice abundance after 38 EMB treatments on six Atlantic salmon farms, in a small archipelago in British Colombia, Canada, between 2007 and 2018. We fitted a standard EMB pharmacokinetic curve to determine the time when fish treated with this product would have EMB tissue concentrations below the recommended target therapeutic level. During the study, we estimated that for each sea lice treatment there was, on average, an abundance of 0.12 juvenile sea lice per fish during the time period when the concentrations of EMB would have been lower than 60ppb, the recommended therapeutic treatment level for sea lice. The findings from this study on metaphylactic anti-parasitic treatments identify a potential driver for drug resistance in sea lice that should be further explored.

AB  - The first small scale study of abdominal parasites of the Slender Sole (Lyopsetta Exilis, Jordan & Gilbert, 1880), from Barkley Sound, British Columbia was conducted June to July 2019. A total of 31 L. exilis individuals were infested with two morphospecies of parasite belonging to the following orders: Acanthocephala and Nematoda. Morphospecies order representatives were found at two infestation sites: the liver and the intestine. Nematodes were the most prevalent across all hosts (100%), also having the highest prevalence, mean abundance, and mean intensity across each infestation site. The intestine was the most infested, at which nematodes had the highest mean abundance and mean intensity of 13.26. Both a acanthocephalans and nematodes exhibited an aggregated distribution across the host sample population. However, the k value for nematodes was greater than one, suggesting a parasite aggregation which is uncommon to most host/parasite associations. The hope is that this research influences management and conservation of Slender Sole populations.

AB  - During the dissection of ascidians Corella willmeriana and Corella inflata , we found copepods of the family Notodelphyidae living in the pharyngeal basket. The family Notodelphyidae has long been described morphologically and phylogenetically, but interactions between the symbiont and host have not been thoroughly investigated. In light of the gaps associated with these relationships, we conducted a population ecology survey on Corella species and their symbionts, Notodelphys affinis , in Barkley Sound. Thirty ascidians of each Corella sp. ( C. willmeriana and C. inflata ) were collected via snorkeling or by hand from four sites. The internal copepods were segregated, counted, and classified based on maturity. Corresponding ascidians were measured for length. We determined the frequency of hosts harboring varying counts of copepods and the percent prevalence of copepods in the host population. First, we found that N. affinis is a symbiont of C. inflata , this is to our knowledge the first description of this association. We found that a majority of ascidians hold a few copepods and a minority of ascidians hold many copepods. This resulted in a highly aggregated distribution which was “right-skewed”, a distribution that is common among parasite populations. In addition, we determined the relationship between the total count of copepods and the length of ascidians. We found this comparison to have a weak correlation, meaning that the size of the host might not determine the population of the parasite. Finally, we investigated the relationship between the count of adult copepods, the count of pre-adult copepods, and the total copepod count. We found that the adult N. affinis are the major contributor to the total copepod population in ascidians.

AB  - In 2018, resistance to the sea lice pesticide emamectin benzoate (EMB) was reported to have developed on multiple open-net pen salmon farms in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia. In BC, EMB is the primary pesticide used by salmon farms to control their sea lice populations. Without EMB or alternative treatments, sea lice management can become impaired. Ineffective management can lead to a dramatic increase in sea lice infestations on farms and ultimately endanger wild salmon populations. Substantial resistance to EMB has developed throughout many salmon farming regions around the world, whereas British Columbia is one of the exceptions. Acute instances of EMB resistance have occurred in several farming regions of BC since 2015, but widespread resistance has not been observed. Cedar Coast Field Station conducted a bioassay to determine a baseline for sea lice sensitivity to EMB. When compared to bioassays in the future, this baseline could be used to determine whether sea lice have developed resistance to EMB. This research aims to determine how sensitive “wild-type" sea lice are to EMB treatments. Motile stage sea lice of both sexes with the exception of adult females were collected off adult wild salmon caught by sport fisherman in Clayoquot Sound. These sea lice were exposed to various concentrations of EMB. We recorded the response of sea lice after 24 hours of submersion in each concentration. We used a generalized linear fixed-effect model to analyze our data. This analysis provides no evidence of resistance being detected, as resistance can only be described across several bioassays. We calculated EC50 ￼values for males and females of each life stage. PAL II males were sensitive to an EC50 ￼of 119.6 ppb, PAL II females were sensitive to an EC50 ￼of 46.3, and adult males were sensitive to an EC50 ￼of 152.2. Future bioassays should be performed to determine if resistance to EMB has developed in “farm-type” sea lice parasitizing wild juvenile salmon throughout Clayoquot Sound.

AB  - Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.

AB  - Macroparasites are generally aggregated within their hosts with infection and aggregation levels resulting from a continuous arms race between maintaining high mating probability and host mortality low for which host and environmentally related factors contribute to some extent. Here, infection and aggregation patterns of the macroendoparasites infecting the flatfish Citharus linguatula, Arnoglossus laterna, Lepidorhombus boscii, Scophthalmus rhombus and Platichthys flesus in 3 areas along the Portuguese coast were analysed. Of the 21 macroendoparasite species found only 1 infected all hosts and most were host or area exclusive. For each host-parasite system, values of the indices varied between areas and macroendoparasites were not always aggregated; in fact, some macroendoparasites were generally uniformly distributed, which can be related to specific density-dependent regulation mechanisms. No general pattern was found for infection or aggregation levels of the 3 species infecting more than 2 hosts along the Portuguese coast, i.e. Lecithochirium rufoviride, Nybelinia lingualis and Anisakis simplex s.l., suggesting that regulation mechanisms are not species specific but are locally determined, with host ecology playing a significant role.

AB  - Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were once a thriving species in southern British Columbia, acting as a source of food, livelihood, and recreation. Research on the survival and status of coho salmon in British Columbia has been critical since an unprecedented moratorium on Interior Fraser River stocks was put in place in 1998, leading to its designation as an endangered species. Since then, no comprehensive literature review has been undertaken on coho salmon. The present paper outlines current publication trends since the early 1990s, covering research areas that include the management and regulation of wild-capture coho salmon fisheries, hatchery enhancement efforts, as well as the pertinent factors that resulted in low returns. A complementary analysis did reveal a progressive downward shift in the total publication records pertaining, but not limited to, coho salmon in British Columbia. This review process identifies future steps and guidelines that policy makers and fisheries managers should take into account to improve the conservation outlook of coho salmon. Emerging technologies such as the use of genomic identification tools, more consistent and thorough data gathering processes, as well as reformed hatchery rearing practices, have all been identified as decisive action items.

AB  - Parasites generate costs for managing infections as well as prophylactic treatment in finfish aquaculture. Based on estimated hatchery losses to parasitism of 20%, the authors estimated annual global loss of juvenile fish to parasites at U.S. $107.31 million to $134.14 million. Assuming parasites are responsible for losses of 1% to 10% of harvest-size fish, the value of these fish was estimated at $945.00 million to $9.45 billion. Combining the hatchery and growout figures, the parasites’ annual cost was tentatively estimated at $1.05 billion to $9.58 billion.

AB  - The salmon farming industry uses coastal, temperate marine waters to culture salmon in flow-through net pens. As marine currents pass through salmon farms, pathogens are carried in both directions between two highly contrasting environments. When wild fish are infected with pathogens spilling from the farm environment, the natural mechanisms that work to prevent epizootics become inoperative. The 18-year decline of Canada's largest salmon fishery, on Fraser River Sockeye Salmon, triggered a comprehensive federal commission to determine the cause. Two of the recommendations from this commission call for removal of the salmon farms from the Discovery Islands of British Columbia (BC), a bottleneck in the Sockeye Salmon migration route, if the evidence indicates that the industry generates greater than minimal risk of serious harm to the Fraser River Sockeye Salmon. Risk is interpreted as a probability and ‘minimal risk’, in the context of the Precautionary Principle, as a cut-off level on the strength of the scientific evidence needed to justify precautionary measures. Here the available evidence of the risk caused by sea lice and viruses from salmon farms on wild salmon is considered. From this perspective, the evidence is unambiguous. Salmon farms in the region of the Discovery Islands generate greater than minimal risk of serious harm to Fraser River Sockeye Salmon. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the risk factors identified are specific to Fraser River Sockeye Salmon, as many of them apply to other areas and salmon species in the north eastern Pacific and globally.

AB  - The spread of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) from salmon farms probably contributes to declines of some native Pacific salmon populations. Migration normally protects juvenile wild Pacific salmon from the marine ectoparasite in coastal waters by separating juvenile salmon from infected wild adults that are located offshore. Farmed salmon populations dwarf natural coastal host populations, particularly in winter, leading to biomagnification of louse populations. By spring, there may be large numbers of lice on farmed salmon, and this is associated with recurrent parasite infestations of wild juvenile salmon and depressed wild salmon stocks. Abiotic (eg temperature and salinity), biotic (eg predator abundance and food availability), and management (eg periodically emptying farms and applying chemical parasiticides) factors are thought to mediate the louse threat, but none have been well studied. Policy is needed that protects undeveloped juvenile salmon habitats and that supports long-term study of salmon ecosystems, to evaluate the sustainability of wild and farmed salmon. © The Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Emerging diseases are impacting animals under high-density culture, yet few studies assess their importance to wild populations. Microparasites selected for enhanced virulence in culture settings should be less successful maintaining infectivity in wild populations, as once the host dies, there are limited opportunities to infect new individuals. Instead, moderately virulent microparasites persisting for long periods across multiple environments are of greatest concern. Evolved resistance to endemic microparasites may reduce susceptibilities, but as barriers to microparasite distributions are weakened, and environments become more stressful, unexposed populations may be impacted and pathogenicity enhanced. We provide an overview of the evolutionary and ecological impacts of infectious diseases in wild salmon and suggest ways in which modern technologies can elucidate the microparasites of greatest potential import. We present four case studies that resolve microparasite impacts on adult salmon migration success, impact of river warming on microparasite replication, and infection status on susceptibility to predation. Future health of wild salmon must be considered in a holistic context that includes the cumulative or synergistic impacts of multiple stressors. These approaches will identify populations at greatest risk, critically needed to manage and potentially ameliorate the shifts in current or future trajectories of wild populations. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Changing environments have the potential to alter the fitness of organisms through effects on components of fitness such as energy acquisition, metabolic cost, growth rate, survivorship, and reproductive output. Organisms, on the other hand, can alter aspects of their physiology and life histories through phenotypic plasticity as well as through genetic change in populations (selection). Researchers examining the effects of environmental variables frequently concentrate on individual components of fitness, although methods exist to combine these into a population level estimate of average fitness, as the per capita rate of population growth for a set of identical individuals with a particular set of traits. Recent advances in energetic modeling have provided excellent data on energy intake and costs leading to growth, reproduction, and other life-history parameters; these in turn have consequences for survivorship at all life-history stages, and thus for fitness. Components of fitness alone (performance measures) are useful in determining organism response to changing conditions, but are often not good predictors of fitness; they can differ in both form and magnitude, as demonstrated in our model. Here, we combine an energetics model for growth and allocation with a matrix model that calculates population growth rate for a group of individuals with a particular set of traits. We use intertidal mussels as an example, because data exist for some of the important energetic and life-history parameters, and because there is a hypothesized energetic trade-off between byssus production (affecting survivorship), and energy used for growth and reproduction. The model shows exactly how strong this trade-off is in terms of overall fitness, and it illustrates conditions where fitness components are good predictors of actual fitness, and cases where they are not. In addition, the model is used to examine the effects of environmental change on this trade-off and on both fitness and on individual fitness components.

AB  - The reproductive strategies of an organism play a major role in the dynamics of the population and the biogeography and continuity of the species. Numerous processes are involved in reproduction leading to the production of offspring. Although diverse processes are involved in oogenesis (the production of eggs) and spermatogenesis (the production of sperm), the basic patterns of gametogenesis are similar amongst invertebrates, with the proliferation and differentiation of germ cells leading to the final production of mature gametes. The production of gametes, especially eggs, is energetically expensive, and therefore strongly sensitive to selective pressures. An organism can ingest and assimilate a limited amount of energy from the environment. The different ways by which energy is allocated to growth and reproduction in order to maximize fitness forms the basis of the differing life-history strategies that have developed in marine invertebrates. Fecundity is defined as the number of offspring produced by a female in a determined time period. The term fecundity needs to be explicitly defined in each study in order to obtain the maximum information from the data analysed. Because of the variety of egg production patterns found among marine invertebrates, a wide range of methodologies has been developed to quantify fecundity. These include direct egg counts in brooding species, spawning induction in live individuals and histological studies of preserved material. Specific considerations need to be taken into account for colonial organisms, because of their modular organization. The production of eggs requires an optimal allocation of energy into growth and reproduction for the maximization of parental fitness. Fecundity is central in studies of life-history theory and in the development of life-history models because it is directly related to energy allocation and partitioning. There are important relationships and trade-offs between fecundity and other life-history traits, such as egg size, female size and age, age at first reproduction, reproductive effort and residual reproductive value. These trade-offs, together with morpho-functional constraints and genetic variation determine the evolution of life histories through natural selection. Fecundity is a highly plastic character within the limits defined by the bioenergetics and life-history strategy of the organism. Egg production is affected mainly by environmental factors such as food quantity and quality, temperature or presence of toxic elements in the habitat. The differences in fecundity found among closely related species from different biogeographical locations reflect, at least in part, the differing environmental conditions of their habitat.

AB  - Canada's Species at Risk Act (SARA) and the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) have adopted different approaches to achieve overlapping goals. We compare the ESA and SARA, focusing on the roles of science and policy in determining which species warrant legal protection. Our analysis suggests that each act could benefit from mimicking the strengths of the other, and both could be strengthened by greater clarity and transparency of listing determinations. A particular strength of SARA is that all evaluations of species' status are conducted by a single national scientific body. The ESA does not involve a comparable national body but has more stringent legal deadlines for listing actions, and listing decisions cannot by law consider socioeconomic factors (as can occur under SARA). The conservation of biodiversity would be enhanced if both acts were complemented by additional programs focused on broader efforts that protect more species before individual intervention is needed.

AB  - Aquaculture has been responsible for an impressive growth in the global supply of seafood. As of 2016, more than half of all global seafood production comes from aquaculture. To meet future global seafood demands, there is need and opportunity to expand marine aquaculture production in ways that are both socially and ecologically sustainable. This requires integrating biophysical, social, and engineering sciences. Such interdisciplinary research is difficult due to the complexity and multi-scale aspects of marine aquaculture and inherent challenges researchers face working across disciplines. To this end, we developed a framework based on Elinor Ostrom's social-ecological system framework (SESF) to guide interdisciplinary research on marine aquaculture. We first present the framework and the social-ecological system variables relevant to research on marine aquaculture and then illustrate one application of this framework to interdisciplinary research underway in Maine, the largest producer of marine aquaculture products in the United States. We use the framework to compare oyster aquaculture in two study regions, with a focus on factors influencing the social and biophysical carrying capacity. We conclude that the flexibility provided by the SESF is well suited to inform interdisciplinary research on marine aquaculture, especially comparative, cross-case analysis.

AB  - Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs are reshaping the governance of ecosystems and natural resources around the world. These programs often occur in spaces that are unceded, contested, or otherwise not legally recognized as Indigenous homelands, customary areas, and territories. Building on the discourses of Indigenous self-determination, nationhood, and cultural responsibilities, this paper examines how PES programs produce unique outcomes for Indigenous peoples as ecosystem services providers. Our findings demonstrate and substantiate three themes that impact Indigenous ecosystem services providers uniquely: (1) the internationally recognized right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent for Indigenous peoples; (2) the reinforcement of settler colonial jurisdiction; and (3) mismatches between Indigenous knowledges and PES-type approaches. The ways that PES programs run the risk of reifying and reducing Indigenous knowledges have not yet been adequately considered within current PES approaches. Our findings enable a conceptualization of PES as a new conservation tool within ongoing histories of land management and dispossession by settler colonial governments. We assess the strengths and challenges of PES programs as a departure from previous conservation modalities.

AB  - The food sovereignty movement initiated in 1996 by a transnational organization of peasants, La Via Campesina, representing 148 organizations from 69 countries, became central to self-determination and decolonial mobilization embodied by Indigenous peoples throughout the world. Utilizing the framework of decolonization and sustainable self-determination, this article analyzes the concept of food sovereignty to articulate an understanding of its potential for action in revitalizing Indigenous food practices and ecological knowledge in the United States and Canada. The food sovereignty movement challenged the hegemony of the globalized, neoliberal, industrial, capital-intensive, corporate-led model of agriculture that created destructive economic policies that marginalized small-scale farmers, removed them from their land, and forced them into the global market economy as wage laborers. Framed within a larger rights discourse, the food sovereignty movement called for the right of all peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food and the right to define their own food and agricultural systems. “Indigenizing” food sovereignty moves beyond a rights based discourse by emphasizing the cultural responsibilities and relationships Indigenous peoples have with their environment and the efforts being made by Indigenous communities to restore these relationships through the revitalization of Indigenous foods and ecological knowledge systems as they assert control over their own foods and practices.

AB  - This article explores how conceptualizing fish as food, rather than primarily as a resource or commodity supports a shift towards more systems-based approaches to engaging with fisheries (i.e. considering the relationships between ecosystems, people, management and policy). A “fish as food” lens is operationalized by drawing on the theory and practice of food sovereignty. While fishing people and communities have always been a core part of the food sovereignty movement, there have been limited efforts in the academic literature to explore these connections directly. Drawing on examples primarily from a Canadian context, it is argued that a deeper engagement between fisheries and food sovereignty is long overdue, particularly as a growing body of research on small-scale fisheries seeks to address social-ecological relationships and issues of power that are also at the core of a food sovereignty approach. This article identifies the opportunities and limitations of engaging with food sovereignty in the context of small-scale fisheries and suggests a series of key questions for future fish as food research and policy.

AB  - Social licence is rooted in perceptions of local rights holders and stakeholders. The disease focus of aquaculture health policy, practices, and research insufficiently reflects societal expectations for aquafarms to protect health of shared resources. Our case study of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming in British Columbia (BC), Canada, assessed the readiness of aquaculture to change from managing health as the absence of disease to a perspective of health as well-being to maintain social licence. We drafted an index of well-being based on agroecosystem health and socio-ecological health principles. We then reviewed publicly available industry and government information and undertook key informant interviews. The industry was well situated to develop and use a well-being index. Interviewees saw value in a well-being index and found it compatible with area-based management. Many elements of the index were being collected but there would be challenges to overcoming feelings of over-regulation; negotiating specific indicators for local situations; and securing the necessary expertise to integrate and assess the diversity of information. Health conflicts and disagreements facing salmon farming in BC are like those in other aquaculture sectors. Social licence may be improved if companies transparently report their state of the health by adapting this conceptual framework.

AB  - Diseases resulting from zoonotic transmission of parasites are common. Humans become infected through food, water, soil and close contact with animals. Most parasitic zoonoses are neglected diseases despite causing a considerable global burden of ill health in humans and having a substantial financial burden on livestock industries. This review aims to bring together the current data available on global burden estimates of parasitic zoonoses and indicate any changes in the trends of these diseases. There is a clear need of such information as interventions to control zoonoses are often in their animal hosts. The costs of such interventions together with animal health issues will drive the cost effectiveness of intervention strategies. What is apparent is that collectively, parasitic zoonoses probably have a similar human disease burden to any one of the big three human infectious diseases: malaria, tuberculosis or HIV in addition to animal health burden. Although the global burden for most parasitic zoonoses is not yet known, the major contributors to the global burden of parasitic zoonoses are toxoplasmosis, food borne trematode infections, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, leishmaniosis and zoonotic schistosomosis. In addition, diarrhoea resulting from zoonotic protozoa may have a significant impact. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Access, defined as the ability to use and benefit from available marine resources or areas of the ocean or coast, is important for the well-being and sustainability of coastal communities. In Canada, access to marine resources and ocean spaces is a significant issue for many coastal and Indigenous communities due to intensifying activity and competition in the marine environment. The general trend of loss of access has implications for these communities, and for Canadian society. In this review and policy perspective, we argue that access for coastal and Indigenous communities should be a priority consideration in all policies and decision-making processes related to fisheries and the ocean in Canada. This paper reviews how access affects the well-being of coastal communities, factors that support or undermine access, and research priorities to inform policy. Recommended actions include: ensuring access is transparently considered in all ocean-related decisions; supporting research to fill knowledge gaps on access to enable effective responses; making data accessible and including communities in decision-making that grants or restricts access to adjacent marine resources and spaces; ensuring updated laws, policies and planning processes explicitly incorporate access considerations; and, identifying and prioritizing actions to maintain and increase access. Taking action now could reverse the current trend and ensure that coastal and Indigenous communities thrive in the future. This is not just a Canadian issue. Globally, the ability of coastal and Indigenous communities to access and benefit from the marine environment should be at the forefront in all deliberations related to the oceans.

AB  - An organism’s ability to respond effectively to environmental change is critical to its survival. Yet, life stage and overall condition can dictate tolerance thresholds to heightened environmental stressors, such that stress may not be equally felt across individuals and at all times. Also, the transcriptional responses induced by environmental changes can reflect both generalized responses as well as others that are highly specific to the type of change being experienced. Thus, if transcriptional biomarkers specific to a stressor, even under multi-stressor conditions, can be identified, the biomarkers could then be applied in natural environments to determine when and where an individual experiences such a stressor. Here, we experimentally challenged juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to validate candidate gill gene expression biomarkers. A sophisticated experimental design manipulated salinity (freshwater, brackish water and seawater), temperature (10, 14 and 18°C) and dissolved oxygen (normoxia and hypoxia) in all 18 possible combinations for 6 days using separate trials for three smolt statuses (pre-smolt, smolt and de-smolt). In addition, changes in juvenile behaviour, plasma variables, gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity, body size, body morphology and skin pigmentation supplemented the gene expression responses. We identified biomarkers specific to salinity and temperature that transcended the multiple stressors, smolt status and mortality (live, dead and moribund). Similar biomarkers for dissolved oxygen were not identified. This work demonstrates the unique power of gene expression biomarkers to identify a specific stressor even under multi-stressor conditions, and we discuss our next steps for hypoxia biomarkers using an RNA-seq study.

AB  - Salmon lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, are naturally occurring parasites of salmon in sea water. Intensive salmon farming provides better conditions for parasite growth and transmission compared with natural conditions, creating problems for both the salmon farming industry and, under certain conditions, wild salmonids. Salmon lice originating from farms negatively impact wild stocks of salmonids, although the extent of the impact is a matter of debate. Estimates from Ireland and Norway indicate an odds ratio of 1.1:1-1.2:1 for sea lice treated Atlantic salmon smolt to survive sea migration compared to untreated smolts. This is considered to have a moderate population regulatory effect. The development of resistance against drugs most commonly used to treat salmon lice is a serious concern for both wild and farmed fish. Several large initiatives have been taken to encourage the development of new strategies, such as vaccines and novel drugs, for the treatment or removal of salmon lice from farmed fish. The newly sequenced salmon louse genome will be an important tool in this work. The use of cleaner fish has emerged as a robust method for controlling salmon lice, and aquaculture production of wrasse is important towards this aim. Salmon lice have large economic consequences for the salmon industry, both as direct costs for the prevention and treatment, but also indirectly through negative public opinion. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Canada is a signatory to United Nations conventions on sustainable development and has entrenched sustainability goals in legislation and policies relating to natural resource sectors including aquaculture. Monitoring and measuring progress towards sustainable development requires the development of sustainability indicators (SI) that, when measured, indicate movement towards or away from a stated policy objective, as well as providing the public with a measure of government accountability. This paper examined the SI used by the Canadian government to assess the social, economic and environmental sustainability of aquaculture production in Canada, whether they adequately measure policy outcomes, and whether national-level SI indicators are appropriate to assessing sustainability at the community-level. The analysis reveals that the Canadian government has made virtually no progress towards translating sustainable aquaculture policy aspirations into measurable SI that evaluate policy outcomes. The mismatch between national policy goals and on-the-ground consequences are highlighted in a community case study of finfish aquaculture in Port Mouton Bay (Nova Scotia). Aquaculture SI and sustainability narratives are discussed in relation to emergent governance arrangements (certification programs) and an international development initiative, Blue Growth, for the world's oceans.

AB  - Early marine survival of juvenile salmon is intimately associated with their physiological condition during smoltification and ocean entry. Smoltification (parr–smolt transformation) is a developmental process that allows salmon to acquire seawater tolerance in preparation for marine living. Traditionally, this developmental process has been monitored using gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity or plasma hormones, but gill gene expression offers the possibility of another method. Here, we describe the discovery of candidate genes from gill tissue for staging smoltification using comparisons of microarray studies with particular focus on the commonalities between anadromous Rainbow trout and Sockeye salmon datasets, as well as a literature comparison encompassing more species. A subset of 37 candidate genes mainly from the microarray analyses was used for TaqMan quantitative PCR assay design and their expression patterns were validated using gill samples from four groups, representing three species and two ecotypes: Coho salmon, Sockeye salmon, stream-type Chinook salmon and ocean-type Chinook salmon. The best smoltification biomarkers, as measured by consistent changes across these four groups, were genes involved in ion regulation, oxygen transport and immunity. Smoltification gene expression patterns (using the top 10 biomarkers) were confirmed by significant correlations with NKA activity and were associated with changes in body brightness, caudal fin darkness and caudal peduncle length. We incorporate gene expression patterns of pre-smolt, smolt and de-smolt trials from acute seawater transfers from a companion study to develop a preliminary seawater tolerance classification model for ocean-type Chinook salmon. This work demonstrates the potential of gene expression biomarkers to stage smoltification and classify juveniles as pre-smolt, smolt or de-smolt.

AB  - Recent shifts towards ecosystem-based management and other holistic and participatory forms of oceans governance and management have come with demands for ways to better incorporate social data into decision-making processes such as integrated ecosystem assessments. This includes information related to a wide range of values associated with different aspects of marine social-ecological systems. This paper addresses that demand by first discussing various notions of value in the literature, and then presenting two case studies from British Columbia, Canada that illuminate some of the opportunities and complexities of using a mix of quantitative and qualitative approaches to bear on the challenge. Findings suggest that values are diverse and are contextually dependent, varying at small scales. Findings further suggest that values are hierarchically arranged and grouped differently by individuals into what might be called perspectives. Finally, the findings highlight that mixed-methods approaches featuring qualitative and quantitative elements may provide a step towards resolving tensions between, on one the one hand, a need to distil complex systems into observable, measurable indicators where the inevitable tradeoffs involved in resource management can be articulated, weighed, and on the other hand, a sense that characterizing the broad range of values that are relevant in shaping attitudes and conceptions of “what should be” in marine systems requires holistic thinking and attention to scale, context, relationality, subjectivity and rich detail.

This paper examines the gap between recent research on aquaculture and social licence, and a large and complex body of scholarship on social licence in mining and other resource intensive industries. This gap provides the basis for a research agenda for social licence in aquaculture that engages with critical debates in mining, while being sensitive to the sectoral differences between mining and aquaculture.

AB  - Finfish net-pen aquaculture in Canada is an important economic industry that supports coastal rural livelihoods. However, aquaculture development faces several types of barriers, including technological, environmental, regulatory, and social. Public perceptions linked to the aforementioned barriers have largely influenced aquaculture development in Canada, where maintaining social acceptance and public trust have been an enduring challenge. Since the media is important for spreading information and shaping public opinion, this study explored how media defines aquaculture to better understand the public discourse and implications for policy. Using qualitative and quantitative content analysis to explore the coverage of major Canadian newspapers in 2015 and 2016, we found a complex discourse expressing a range of aquaculture attributes and stakeholders. Our results indicate that media frames finfish net-pen aquaculture in a mostly negative tone, although there are considerable regional variabilities and differences across specific attributes. Risk-oriented frames focused on environmental challenges and management responses, while positive aspects surrounded scientific and technological advances and economic benefits. Complex interactions between environmental, social, economic, and management attributes further emphasizes the multi-faceted nature of the public discourse surrounding finfish aquaculture in Canada. Media relied not only on environmental groups or scientists in their reporting, but also considerably on fish farmers and government to offer expert opinions or as proponents of the industry. This supports a shift away from an ‘elitist’ role of the media, towards a more ‘deliberative’ role of balancing perspectives and democratic dialogue. These findings have implications for private and public responses and highlight the need for interdisciplinary solutions that emphasize transparency, communication, and accountability to improve public trust and guide sector development.

AB  - Industrial salmon aquaculture was introduced to British Columbia on the basis of three promises: (1) to provide jobs and resources to coastal communities—especially First Nations—that had been hard hit by the downturn in the province’s forest and fishing industries; (2) to help to feed the world, by delivering on the potential to use the oceans to farm fish to provide protein-rich food; and (3) to relieve pressure on increasingly threatened coastal salmon stocks. Salmon aquaculture thus looked to be an ideal contribution to addressing important global problems. Since its introduction in 1980, however, salmon aquaculture has largely failed to deliver on its promises, spawning an increasingly vocal campaign by environmental groups defining it as a problem in its own right.

AB  - The Canadian Species at Risk Act (SARA) was implemented in 2003. Since 2003, no fully marine Atlantic Canadian fish species has been listed and some observers are seriously questioning the extent to which SARA is effectively protecting marine fish species. Three species of wolffish found in North Atlantic waters were placed onto the SARA list in 2003 when it was implemented. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) originally listed these species in 2000 and 2001. The COSEWIC listings were based on catch-rate trends over large spatial scales from a relatively short time series of offshore research vessel survey data and status reports derived from research for an honours thesis. This case study of the wolffish listings draws on results from semi-structured interviews with key informants familiar with the listing and post-listing events, an analysis of existing documents and research on the SARA process, and on data from wolffish-focused Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) interviews with commercial fish harvesters in the Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. The results shed light on the wolffish listing process including perceptions of how the implementation of SARA has affected the process and prospects for listing fully marine species. The post-SARA listing developments in relation to wolffish, including harvesters' views about the listing are also explored. The results indicate mixed views about the benefits and problems associated with the requirement for public consultations and incorporation of stakeholder knowledge into the listing process under SARA. There is some evidence that the wolffish listing process has increased harvester stewardship and engagement and benefitted from their input into the safe release of wolffish. Finally, little attention has been paid by any of the stakeholder groups consulted to the potential future delisting of wolffish, arguably the most important goal of species conservation initiatives. Without delisting requirements or timelines set out in a species recovery plan it is impossible to establish concrete guidelines for recovery. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In accordance with the Species at Risk Act (SARA), the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) is nationally responsible for assessing wildlife species considered to be at risk of extinction. A parliamentary review of SARA provides impetus for an up-to-date summary of recent assessments (2006-2008) and a spatiotemporal analysis of the status of Canada's largest vertebrate group of species at risk, fishes. From April 1978 through December 2008, COSEWIC had assessed 13 wildlife species as extinct and 564 at some level of risk (extirpated, endangered, threatened, special concern). Among these 577 assessments, 112 are for fishes (76% freshwater and diadromous; 24% marine). Slightly more than one-quarter (27%) of Canada's 205 freshwater and diadromous species of fishes, many of which are in southwestern Ontario and southeastern Quebec, have been assessed as being at risk throughout all or parts of their ranges. The percentage of Canadian freshwater and diadromous fish species assessed by COSEWIC as endangered or threatened (16%) is similar to the percentage of freshwater and diadromous fishes in the US that have been listed under the Endangered Species Act (12%). The proportion of wholly freshwater fishes assessed by COSEWIC that have been added to SARA's legal schedule is somewhat lower than that of other taxa. However, whereas the US listed its first marine fish in 2005, the Canadian government has to date not accepted COSEWIC's advice to list an endangered or threatened marine fish since the proclamation of SARA in 2003.

AB  - Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.
